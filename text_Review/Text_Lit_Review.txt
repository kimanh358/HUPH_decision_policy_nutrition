IV. Review of Existing Literature

1. Empirical Studies
School nutrition policies play an important role in improving students' diets and health. These policies have been extensively studied to assess their impact on student health, academic achievement, and overall well-being. Many studies have shown that school nutrition interventions have positive effects, although the effectiveness of different approaches varies.
School feeding policies significantly contribute to enhancing the nutritional environment and student health. In Canada, a study by Mullally et al. showed favorable changes in school children's food intake in parallel with the introduction of a school nutrition policy (Mullally et al., 2010). According to Martinelli et al. (2021), the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) menu has undergone significant changes over time, in line with federal nutrition policies such as the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA). These changes in food service over time have not affected all schools in the same way. These changes include increasing the number of healthy options and reducing less nutritious options, contributing to improving the nutritional quality of school meals (Martinelli et al., 2023b). Similarly, in the UK, a study by Davies et al. (2008) found that new school lunch standards there were both nutrient and food-based, and clearly defining portion sizes helped ensure that students consumed the recommended amount of nutrients and also informed school meal standards (Davies et al., 2008). 
However, despite these improvements, challenges remain. A study by Fox et al. (2021) in the United States found that the majority of school breakfasts (92%) and lunches (69%) exceeded the added sugar limits set by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) 2015–2020. The top sources of added sugars in breakfasts consumed by children were sweetened cold cereals, condiments, and toppings; the top sources of added sugars in children's lunches were flavored skim milk and pastries. The amount of added sugars in children's diets over a 24-hour period did not meet the DGA's recommended limits for added sugars (Fox et al., 2021). Additionally, a study by Gaudin et al. (2023) in Canada found that mandatory nutrition policies improved students’ diet quality scores (DQI) during school hours, especially higher school-time dietary quality scores among boys, primary school children, and food-secure and middle-high income household groups, but had no significant impact on overall daily diet (Gaudin et al., 2023). The study assessed the feasibility of a school meal program aimed at improving meal quality and fostering collaboration among nutrition staff, teachers, principals, and the community. The program was implemented in seven elementary schools in North Carolina, with key activities including culinary training for nutrition staff, financial support to promote healthy food choices, and tasting events to encourage student participation. Results showed that the program successfully generated enthusiasm for school meals and enhanced healthy food choices. Students responded positively to the tasting sessions, nutrition staff incorporated new dishes into the menu, and sustainable relationships were established to support program expansion (Calancie et al., 2018). These findings highlight the varying effectiveness of nutrition policies in different contexts.
Local and Regional Nutrition Policy Outcomes
Various local initiatives have demonstrated both successes and limitations. Belansky et al.’s study found that local nutrition policies in Colorado elementary schools had some positive effects, such as increasing the proportion of schools offering healthy foods in class meals (from 21.4% in 2005 to 48.7% in 2007) and increasing the use of healthier foods in lunch such as fresh fruit and skinless poultry (Belansky et al., 2010b). In addition, School Feeding Programs (SFPs) are considered an important tool to reduce malnutrition and improve the living conditions of children, especially in disadvantaged communities. Research on SFPs emphasizes that in addition to nutritional benefits, the program also promotes community development, gender equality, and improved educational opportunities for children. The effectiveness of SFPs can be assessed through three main criteria: academic success (based on school attendance, retention, and learning outcomes), nutritional improvement (reducing malnutrition and enhancing nutrition education), and community development (through the participation of farmers and local food providers). These factors help ensure that school feeding programs not only address immediate poverty but also create a foundation for sustainable development for the community (Aroesty et al., 2018).
However, these policies were still limited in terms of specific regulations and did not significantly affect school meal service practices. A study in Connecticut by E. Castellari et al. analyzed the impact of providing a morning snack on elementary school students. The results showed that students tended to shift calories from lunch to snacks, while significantly reducing hunger during school hours. This suggests that the timing and organization of school meals play an important role in regulating children’s eating habits. Research indicates that school nutrition policies have multidimensional impacts on students' eating habits and health (Castellari & Berning, 2016). Mullally et al. (2010) conducted a study in Canada and found that implementing a school nutrition policy improved the consumption of vegetables, fruits, and dairy products among primary school children (Mullally et al., 2010).  In England and Scotland, Parnham et al. (2022) evaluated the Universal Free School Meal (UIFSM) policy and found that the proportion of students consuming school meals increased significantly, while the consumption of foods associated with packed lunches, crisps, and some nutrients, such as total fat and sodium of foods high in salt and fat decreased, particularly among low-income groups. However, the policy did not lead to the expected increase in fruit and vegetable consumption. These studies highlight the complexity of designing effective school nutrition interventions. As such, to help identify areas for improvement, future studies should assess food standards compliance of school meals across a range of school types and deprivation levels (Parnham et al., 2022).
International Approaches to School Nutrition
Internationally, school nutrition policies vary widely A free breakfast program in elementary schools in Bonn, Germany, was implemented to assess the feasibility and acceptability of free school breakfasts. What is unique about this breakfast project is that it combines several prerequisites that make it promising for the promotion and prevention of health in children: (1) it is implemented in compulsory primary schools and is free of charge to children, enabling effective access, especially for socially disadvantaged children, without stigmatization, (2) it focuses on breakfast as an important component of a healthy diet, and (3) it enables schools to organize and implement the program without the need for formal authoritative prescription. Among 54 elementary schools, 26% (14 schools) participated in the project, motivated by concerns that many students brought low-quality breakfasts. Breakfast was provided on most school days, including components such as vegetables and fruits (100%), cereals and milk (79%), and beverages (36%). Evaluation results from the schools indicated that students were receptive to the initiative. The program has the potential to improve health and support disadvantaged children because it is free, non-discriminatory, and allows for flexibility in school organization (Hockamp et al., 2024). Similarly, Chen et al. (2014) conducted a study of a multicultural intervention program in low-income schools. The study examined the effectiveness of a school-based intervention that had two unique components: (1) exposing students to ethnic vegetables in the classroom through food preparation and tasting activities; (2) promoting home cooking by distributing take-home cooking kits with ingredients and recipes. Results showed that introducing vegetables from different cultures not only increased students’ familiarity with healthy foods but also encouraged parental involvement in home meal preparation. Both quantitative and qualitative data indicated significant increases in students’ vegetable preferences and consumption after participating in the program (Chen et al., 2014). In Thailand, Pongutta et al. (2023) studied the Dekthai Kamsai complex school nutrition program and found that it improved BMI, BAZ, and HAZ, while reducing obesity and malnutrition rates. This was achieved through a combination of factors, including providing healthy meals, nutrition education, increasing physical activity, and improving school hygiene (Pongutta et al., 2023). A study by Ohri-Vachaspati et al. (2016) in the United States found that the proportion of schools with salad bars increased from 17.1% (2006-2007) to 29.6% (2012-2013) thanks to support from the government and nutrition organizations (Ohri-Vachaspati et al., 2016). A study by Martinelli et al. (2021) also showed similar results when the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) significantly improved the quality of meals by adjusting to federal nutrition policy. The study found improvements in school food service over time, through a steady increase in the number of healthy items and a simultaneous decrease in unhealthy items. These trends suggest that national nutrition policies can impact student health through measurable changes in the types of foods offered in school meals (Martinelli et al., 2023b). These global initiatives demonstrate the potential of multi-component approaches in addressing school nutrition challenges.
Barriers to Effective School Nutrition Policies
Studies show that school nutrition policies can significantly improve student diet quality and health if implemented effectively. However, in practice, many intervention programs still face challenges and fail to achieve the desired effectiveness. This can be attributed to various influencing factors. Among them, financial resources, the level of support from schools and parents, and students' eating habits are key determinants of policy effectiveness. Additionally, cultural differences, socio-economic conditions, and the ability to monitor policy implementation significantly impact the outcomes of school nutrition programs. In Vietnam, the school meal program was launched in 1977 and expanded to elementary schools in 1980, aiming to provide balanced meals and nutrition education for students. Currently, nearly 100% of preschools and 90% of elementary schools participate in the program. However, due to the lack of official nutrition experts, kitchen staff receive only short-term training, leading to limitations in nutritional quality. Although the program has contributed to reducing malnutrition, several challenges remain, such as insufficient regular monitoring and a lack of emphasis on nutrition education (Trung Le, 2012).

In South Africa, Steyn et al. (2015) conducted a randomized controlled trial of HealthKick -  a three-year randomized controlled trial, which aimed to change the eating habits of schoolchildren in a low-income area. However, the study results showed that implementation was uneven, with many schools planning events but not actually implementing them due to factors such as being too busy with regular school work and lack of time; lack of resources and lack of money; poor facilities; poor home environments for many learners; lack of parental involvement and unhealthy food mainly sold at school, leading to limited effectiveness of the trial (Steyn et al., 2015).
Family socioeconomic status and available resources are also factors that influences children's school lunch participation. A study by Sobek et al. (2021) examined factors that influence school lunch participation. The results showed that school lunch participation was primarily related to family factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES) and parents' perceptions of school lunch, which had a significant impact on students' decisions to participate in school lunch. Other common reasons for students not participating included price, taste, and time constraints. Notably, one-third of parents said that their children would participate in school lunch if it were free (Sobek et al., 2021). A study by Mauer et al showed that four main factors related to pupils’ participation in free school meals emerged from the analysis are the popularity of the food served, the attraction to the nearby shopping center, social aspects, and predictability (Mauer et al., 2022). According to Sherry (2008), some schools have implemented measures to promote healthy nutrition such as using notice boards, promotional materials and menus that highlight healthy food options. However, many schools still do not focus on promoting healthy eating practices in the cafeteria (Sherry, 2008, p. 226). This suggests the need for further investment in nutrition education programs to raise awareness of both students and families about school meals (Sherry, 2008). Additionally, research by Taylor et al. (2011) found that implementing a nutrition policy in elementary schools in Prince Edward Island was difficult due to the high cost of healthy foods and limited availability of food that met standards. However, community support, diverse food supply, and parental involvement were considered to be favorable factors for the success of the policy (Taylor et al., 2011). A systematic review by Grigsby-Duffy et al. (2022) analyzed the impact of school nutrition policies on the school food environment. The results showed that among the factors influencing policy implementation, lack of financial resources is a major barrier for schools to provide more healthy food options and additional school resources increase the availability of healthy food. These policies are effective in promoting healthy food but are often difficult to implement, especially due to financial constraints (Grigsby-Duffy et al., 2022). School food regulation also faces tensions between school and parent responsibilities. Most policy makers support the control of food sold in schools, but disagree with the control of food brought from home by students. Additionally, the home environment has a major influence on children's diets, with parental nutrition knowledge and time pressure being two major determinants of food choices (Walton et al., 2013) . These complexities necessitate a balanced approach to nutrition policy design.
Internationally, school feeding policies in the UK, Sweden and Australia vary widely in terms of implementation and compliance. While Sweden provides free meals to most students, there is no robust monitoring mechanism. Australia relies heavily on home-based meals and canteens with low compliance, and national school food standards, however, simply state that the food and drink provided must be “nutritious and suitable”, making the standard too vague to be enforced. In the UK, food standards are partially enforced in schools, but the popularity of take-home meals limits the effectiveness of the policies. What all three countries have in common is that the policies are not actively enforced by the government or lack robust monitoring mechanisms, making it difficult to accurately assess the impact of meal policies on student health (P. Lucas et al., 2017).
Overall, studies have highlighted that financial constraints are among the most significant barriers to the effective implementation of school nutrition policies (Aroesty et al., 2018). When budgets are limited, schools face considerable challenges in providing nutritious meals, particularly in low-income communities where students rely on school meals as their primary source of daily nutrition. In such cases, restricted funding can severely compromise meal quality, negatively impacting students' health and development. A primary concern is the cost of nutrient-dense foods. Fresh vegetables, fruits, and high-quality protein sources tend to be more expensive than processed foods, which are often high in sugar and unhealthy fats. Consequently, budget limitations force schools to opt for cheaper, lower-quality ingredients, leading to meals that fail to meet essential nutritional standards. This not only affects students' physical well-being but also hinders their cognitive development and academic performance. Financial constraints also restrict investments in essential infrastructure and personnel. Many schools lack modern kitchen facilities, proper food storage equipment, and trained nutrition professionals, all of which are crucial for maintaining an effective school feeding program. Additionally, insufficient funding prevents schools from organizing nutrition education programs, depriving students of the knowledge necessary to develop long-term healthy eating habits. Moreover, the enforcement and monitoring of nutrition policies become increasingly difficult when resources are scarce. Schools often struggle to conduct food quality assessments, ensure compliance with food safety regulations, and implement regular nutritional evaluations. Without adequate oversight, the effectiveness of these policies is significantly diminished, making it challenging to achieve their intended objectives.
Ineffective monitoring is another significant barrier to the successful implementation of school nutrition policies. Without regular oversight and evaluation, many schools fail to fully comply with established nutrition standards, leading to the provision of substandard meals. This issue is particularly concerning in economically disadvantaged areas, where school meals serve as a crucial source of daily nutrition for students. The lack of proper monitoring directly affects students' health and development, undermining the intended benefits of these policies. One of the primary causes of inadequate monitoring is the shortage of resources as mentioned above. Many schools lack sufficient staff and funding to conduct routine inspections of food quality, food safety, and the nutritional value of meals. Furthermore, the absence of standardized monitoring procedures and the lack of strict enforcement mechanisms contribute to weak policy compliance. Without clear accountability measures, schools may not prioritize adherence to nutrition guidelines, resulting in inconsistencies in meal quality. To address this issue, it is essential to strengthen the monitoring framework by implementing more rigorous inspection mechanisms, ensuring transparency in policy enforcement, and fostering greater awareness among school administrators about the importance of student nutrition. By enhancing oversight and accountability, schools can more effectively uphold nutrition standards and promote healthier eating habits among students.
In conclusion, these barriers not only compromise the quality of school meals but also weaken the overall effectiveness of nutrition policies in promoting student health and academic achievement. When schools are unable to provide high-quality, nutritious meals due to financial constraints, inadequate monitoring, or lack of resources, students face an increased risk of malnutrition, which can negatively impact their physical health, cognitive development, and learning outcomes. Poor nutrition is linked to decreased concentration, lower academic performance, and long-term health complications, highlighting the urgency of addressing these challenges.
To effectively overcome these barriers, a collaborative effort is essential. Governments must allocate sufficient funding to school nutrition programs and establish clear regulatory frameworks to ensure policy compliance. Nonprofit organizations can play a crucial role by providing additional financial and logistical support, while communities and families should be actively involved in promoting healthy eating habits both at school and at home. Schools, in turn, must prioritize the implementation of effective nutrition policies by improving food quality, strengthening monitoring mechanisms, and incorporating nutrition education into the curriculum.
By fostering a coordinated and sustained approach, all stakeholders can work together to ensure that every student has consistent access to safe, nutritious, and high-quality meals. Investing in school nutrition is not only a matter of improving individual health but also a fundamental step toward enhancing educational outcomes and building a healthier future generation.
Strategies for Sustainable School Nutrition Programs
In reality, the aforementioned difficulties and challenges not only affect the effectiveness of school nutrition policies but also reduce their positive impact on students' development. Therefore, to improve the quality of school nutrition, comprehensive solutions are needed, such as increasing budget support for school meals, designing scientifically balanced menus, enhancing financial resources, and raising awareness among schools and parents. Additionally, innovations in meal plans and improvements in meal quality are essential. In the long term, efforts should focus on developing sustainable meal models, integrating nutrition education into the curriculum, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to ensure the effective implementation of policies.
Financial sustainability remains a concern, as Taylor et al. (2011) found that schools fear revenue loss when restricting unhealthy foods. Government or nonprofit financial support could alleviate these concerns. Expanding partnerships with safe, clean food providers is another promising strategy. Research by Ohri-Vachaspati et al. (2016) found that schools that participate in food delivery and technical assistance programs such as Farm to School have significantly higher rates of salad bar adoption, which increases students’ access to fresh fruits and vegetables (Ohri-Vachaspati et al., 2016, p. 417). Partnering with local suppliers not only reduces the cost of healthy food, but also contributes to sustainable agriculture. Additionally, Asian countries emphasize multi-component interventions. In Korea, Woo (2015) describes a comprehensive school feeding system, with 100% of schools providing meals and having nutrition teachers to monitor food quality. Nutrition education is integrated into extracurricular activities, along with hands-on experiences such as growing vegetables at school and making kimchi to maintain traditional culture. Taylor et al. (2011) pointed out that some principals and school administrators are concerned about the loss of revenue when implementing policies to limit unhealthy foods, because healthy products are often more expensive and less popular with students (Taylor et al., 2011, p. 209). Therefore, many experts recommend financial support measures from the government or non-profit organizations to help schools maintain nutrition policies without affecting operating budgets.
A study by Hamdi et al. (2024) in the United States examined interventions such as food tasting and creative food naming, which significantly increased the amount of fruits and vegetables consumed by students. These findings highlight the importance of implementing effective policies and interventions to improve school nutrition, thereby contributing to students’ overall health.
Similarly, a study by Pongutta et al. (2022) in Asian countries found that multicomponent nutrition interventions—including nutrition education, increased physical activity, and the provision of healthy foods—were significantly more effective in reducing BMI in children than single interventions. This suggests that combining multiple approaches is the most effective strategy for addressing childhood overweight. In the United States, the "Wellness in the Schools" (WITS) program was implemented to improve school menus and encourage physical activity. According to Koch et al. (2021), students participating in the WITS program consumed 41% more fruits and vegetables than those in the control group. Beyond simply making school menus healthier, the program also included cooking classes, nutrition education, and initiatives to encourage physical activity during recess. These efforts not only helped students develop healthier eating habits but also have the potential to positively impact long-term health. 
Schools, families, and society play a crucial role in effectively implementing school nutrition policies. Schools provide high-quality meals, families guide healthy eating habits, and society supports resources and raises awareness, creating a sustainable nutritional environment for students.
