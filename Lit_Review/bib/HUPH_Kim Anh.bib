“BACKGROUND: The Balanced School Day (BSD) is a scheduling policy that has the potential to impact children’s food behaviors because students are provided with two 20-minute eating opportunities versus the traditional 20-minute lunch. METHODS: We aim to raise awareness of this grassroots academic policy and its potential consequences to inform future decision making and minimize potential unintended negative health consequences. RESULTS: While there is limited research on this schedule, it has been shown that there is less time lost in transition from classroom to recess. Perception surveys have shown that principals and custodians are the most satisfied, followed by parents, teachers, and secretaries, with students being the least satisfied. The BSD is also perceived to improve organization of instructional time, playground cleanliness, and student concentration. Despite these purported benefits, there is limited data on the impact of the BSD on children’s eating habits, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI). While 1 study reported fewer pedometer-measured step counts during breaks in the BSD, more research is needed on the impact of this alternative schedule on children’s food intake and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: School and public health professionals must advocate for ‘‘health impact assessments’’ to assess the health effects of this policy.” (Wu et al., 2015, p. 405)“School Food Policies The framework for Comprehensive School Health recognizes that the whole school environment can directly influence students’ behaviors and ultimately their health.5 In Canada, many jurisdictions have already implemented school nutrition policies in an attempt to influence the school food environment.6,7 These policies often dictate specific nutrition requirements that must be met when food is sold at school, enabling schools to model best practices in nutrition.8 While these policies are applauded, the ‘‘health in all policies’’ framework suggests that it is also important to consider the impact of academic policies that have the potential to impact children’s health. One such policy is the Balanced School Day (BSD)” (Wu et al., 2015, p. 406)

	abstract = {The Universal Infant Free School Meal (UIFSM) policy was introduced in September 2014 in England and January 2015 in Scotland and offered all infant schoolchildren (ages 4-7 years) a free school lunch, regardless of income. Yet, impacts of UIFSM on dietary intakes or social inequalities are not known. A difference-in-differences study using the National Diet and Nutrition Survey assessed pooled pre-UIFSM (2010-2014) and post-UIFSM (2014-2017) dietary data. English or Scottish infant schoolchildren (4-7 years; n = 458) were the intervention group, with junior schoolchildren (8-11 years; n = 401) as controls. We found that implementation of UIFSM led to an increase in infant schoolchildren having a school meal. Impacts on key food groups such as fruit and vegetables or sweetened beverages were not seen. However, there was evidence that the UIFSM policy lowered consumption of foods associated with packed lunches, such as crisps, and some nutrients, such as total fat and sodium. Policy impacts differed by income group, with larger effect sizes in low-income children. In conclusion, evaluation of UIFSM demonstrated some improvements in dietary quality but the findings suggest school meal quality needs to be improved to fully realise the benefits of UIFSM.},

“We found that implementation of UIFSM led to an increase in infant schoolchildren having a school meal. Impacts on key food groups such as fruit and vegetables or sweetened beverages were not seen. However, there was evidence that the UIFSM policy lowered consumption of foods associated with packed lunches, such as crisps, and some nutrients, such as total fat and sodium. Policy impacts differed by income group, with larger effect sizes in low-income children.” (Parnham et al., 2022, p. 1)“However, there was evidence that the UIFSM policy lowered consumption of foods associated with packed lunches, such as crisps, and some nutrients, such as total fat and sodium. Policy impacts differed by income group, with larger effect sizes in low-income children.” (Parnham et al., 2022, p. 1)“Implementation of UIFSM was associated with a 33 percentage point increase in school meal uptake. We found little evidence that UIFSM affected the lunchtime intake of food groups such as fruit and vegetables or SSB. However, there was a reduction in consumption of foods associated with packed lunches, such as crisps, wholemeal and dairy products and an increase in consuming foods associated with school meals, such as puddings. These changes were accompanied by a reduction in total fat, sodium and vitamin A intake at lunch. However, there was no detected change in the amount of sugar consumed. Importantly, the beneficial effect of UIFSM appeared to be greater for low-income children” (Parnham et al., 2022, p. 10)“Our results show a reduction in the total fat, sodium and vitamin A consumed at lunchtime, demonstrating that universal school-based food interventions can have a measurable impact on children’s lunchtime intake. These nutrients are high in common packed lunch items such as crisps and dairy products, which also lowered after UIFSM. The relative change in vitamin A appears to be concerning; however, the absolute intake remained above reference levels at both lunch (175 μg/lunch) [27] and across the day (500 μg/day) [28] in the post-intervention period. Furthermore, only a difference in fat intake (−1.5\% energy; −3.0, −0.0) was observed in the total daily dietary intake, indicating children may compensate for the reduction in sodium at other points in the day. Although this change in fat intake is modest, it has potential to accumulate to a meaningful beneficial impact on child health over time and at a population level” (Parnham et al., 2022, p. 10)“We found no evidence that UIFSM affected sugar intake at lunchtime or in the total diet. The likelihood of infant schoolchildren consuming sugary foods was unchanged, with over 70\% consuming foods high in sugar post-UIFSM. This may indicate that children were switching the source of their sugar intake, for example there is some indication that intake of SSB (before–after difference: −6.3\%; CI −13.2, 0.6; p = 0.08) and yoghurts (before–after difference: −13.5\%; CI −22.9, −4.2; p {\textless} 0.01) in packed lunches were replaced with puddings in school lunches (before–after difference: 16.0\%; CI 5.9, 26.2; p {\textless} 0.01). The School Food Standards explicitly restrict foods high in sugar, such as sugary snacks and confectionery. Therefore, it was expected that UIFSM would lower sugar intake and it is of concern that intake of these items did not decrease post-UIFSM. Action to remove sugary items from school menus is needed to better enable children to reduce their sugar intake.” (Parnham et al., 2022, p. 10)“Our study reports some positive effects of the UIFSM on dietary intakes, but these were not consistent across all outcomes. We hypothesise that this was due to school meals not consistently meeting School Food Standards. For example, consumption of restricted foods, such as foods high in sugar, did not lower; meanwhile, recommended foods, such as fruit and vegetables, did not increase. These findings put a renewed focus on the content of school meals, which although in most cases are preferable to packed lunches, are not always optimal [1]. Variation in the food environment between schools is a major contributing factor to the nutritional quality of school meals. The School Food Standards are mandatory but are not monitored in England. As such, school food quality is determined more by school leadership than central governance. The amount given to schools for UIFSM has only risen once in seven years (from £2.30/meal to £2.34/meal in 2020). Some school leaders suggest this is insufficient and puts increased strain on already limited educational resources [15]. Without adequate funding, support for UIFSM by senior leadership is inconsistent [15,36]. Budget constraints in combination with lack of incentives for complying with School Food Standards are reported to contribute to non-compliance in schools [37]. In a sample of London primary schools, only 43\% had a School Food Standards-compliant food policy [38]. As such, the capability of UIFSM to improve dietary intake is limited by a school’s resources to improve their food environment, which may explain why the UIFSM policy has not yet achieved its potential. To help identify areas for improvement, future research should evaluate the compliance of school meals to School Food Standards across a range of school types and deprivation levels.” (Parnham et al., 2022, p. 12)

	abstract = {Background: Numerous studies in schools in the Western Cape Province, South Africa have shown that children have an unhealthy diet with poor diversity and which is high in sugar and fat. HealthKick (HK) was a three-year randomised controlled trial aimed at promoting healthy eating habits.
Methods: Sixteen schools were selected from two low-income school districts and randomly allocated to intervention (n = 8) or control school (n = 8) status. The HK intervention comprised numerous activities to improve the school nutrition environment such as making healthier food choices available and providing nutrition education support.
Dietary intake was measured by using a 24-h recall in 2009 in 500 grade 4 learners at intervention schools and 498 at control schools, and repeated in 2010 and 2011. A dietary diversity score (DDS) was calculated from nine food groups and frequency of snack food consumption was determined. A school level analysis was performed.
Results: The mean baseline (2009) DDS was low in both arms 4.55 (SD = 1.29) and 4.54 (1.22) in the intervention and control arms respectively, and 49 \% of learners in HK intervention schools had a DDS {\textless}= 4 (=low diversity). A small increase in DDS was observed in both arms by 2011: mean score 4.91 (1.17) and 4.83 (1.29) in the intervention and control arms respectively. The estimated DSS intervention effect over the two years was not significant [0.04 (95 \% CI: -0.37 to 0.46)]. Food groups least consumed were eggs, fruit and vegetables. The most commonly eaten snacking items in 2009 were table sugar in beverages and/or cereals (80.5 \%); followed by potato crisps (53.1 \%); non-carbonated beverages (42.9 \%); sweets (26.7 \%) and sugar-sweetened carbonated beverages (16 \%). Unhealthy snack consumption in terms of frequency of snack items consumed did not improve significantly in intervention or control schools.
Discussion: The results of the HK intervention were disappointing in terms of improvement in DDS and a decrease in unhealthy snacking. We attribute this to the finding that the intervention model used by the researchers may not have been the ideal one to use in a setting where many children came from low-income homes and educators have to deal with daily problems associated with poverty.
Conclusions: The HK intervention did not significantly improve quality of diet of children.},

These included (among other things) nutrition activities related to developing healthy school nutrition policies; providing a nutrition education support; improving school shops by making healthier options available; encouraging the promotion of healthy foods at special events; by encouraging learners to bring healthy lunch boxes to school; and by the initiation of vegetable gardens at schools.” (Steyn et al., 2015, p. 3)“The children in this study consumed a number of high fat and high sugar foods as indicated by the popular snacks. Crisps, fried foods, sweets, carbonated beverages, to name a few, were commonly consumed at the schools. These items were mostly purchased at the school tuck shops or by vendors selling at the school gates. This is indicative of the fact that the schools do not have policies in place” (Steyn et al., 2015, p. 6)“regarding the types of food items for sale on the premises of the school, or that existing policies may not be properly implemented. Since many children are given money to buy food at school [1] it is reasonable to predict that they will purchase items which are cheap and which curb their hunger, Which would often include energy-dense foods that have a low nutritive value [2]. Real progress in” (Steyn et al., 2015, p. 6)“promoting healthy eating behaviours can only be attained if effective policies on the sale of foods are implemented and a healthy school environment is promoted [31].” (Steyn et al., 2015, p. 8)“Many schools planned events but did not actually carry them out. For example, only two nutrition education activities were undertaken in total at all eight schools over the three year period. In the HK intervention the schools themselves were responsible for implementing the nutrition curriculum guide which they had been provided with. Some of the main reasons given by the teachers for” (Steyn et al., 2015, p. 8)“the poor implementation of nutrition events were: being too busy with regular school work and lack of time; poor resources and lack of money; poor physical facilities; poor home environment of many of the learners; lack of parental involvement and unhealthy foods mainly sold at the schools [32]” (Steyn et al., 2015, p. 8)

Studies that reported on the impact of implemented school nutrition policies on food and beverage availability within primary schools were included. Eighteen studies (reported across 20 papers) were included. Fifteen of the included studies reported some positive impacts of policies, including increased availability of healthier foods and decreased availability of less healthy foods. Five studies focused specifically on schools in low-income communities and a further three specifically compared schools by SEP, with mixed findings. Two studies reported on factors influencing policy implementation, reporting a lack of financial resources as a barrier to schools offering a wider selection of healthy foods and additional school resources as increasing the likelihood of offering healthy foods.

Furthermore, the results suggest that well-implemented school nutrition policies that improve the healthiness of foods available are unlikely to exacerbate the socioeconomic gradient of poor nutrition.

“This paper reports on an evaluation of school based education stakeholders’ capacity to implement a millennium meal project at seven schools in a Kenyan village, whose main goal is to provide enough food for school going children. The study which was anchored on the Maslow’s theory of needs as well as the Context Input Process Product (CIPP) model of evaluation used mixed methods research design with ex-post facto and case study as its two research elements. The mixed methods was adopted because when both qualitative and quantitative approaches are used in a single study, the strengths of both produce a research synergy in which the collective benefits are greater than what is obtained from either approach alone. A sample size of 186 participants was selected from seven (7) primary schools using stratified random sampling. The participants selected purposively included pupils, teachers, head teachers, parents, Area Education Officer (AEO) and project staff. The evaluation research instruments used in the study were questionnaires, face to face interview guide, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and document analysis guide. The study findings indicated that the project was implemented with great success as indicated by stakeholders’ capacity to understand project objectives and the matching implementation strategies, visible positive attitude towards the project, community poverty reduction through the project and sustainable approaches for the project.” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 2)“Effective implementation of the school meals project The study investigated the extent to which the school meals project in public primary schools in Yala Division had been effectively implemented. All the head teachers who participated in the study said that the school meal project had been implemented in their schools as an intervention. Majority (6) of them pointed out that the project had been effectively implemented according to the implementation plan. The stakeholders were playing their respective roles. Each parent for example brought to school the recommended ration of maize and beans every term. Only one (1) indicated that they it had not been effectively implemented. Parents in the study were also asked whether the project staff had effectively implemented the SMP. A majority of the parents (12) indicated that the project staff had effectively implemented the SMP. They were available for advice whenever the project experienced challenges. The respondents were then asked to inform on indicators that reflected effective project implementation. They said that the project effectiveness in the schools was visible by the introduction of new facilities as well as the renovation of existing ones.” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 16)“The project had also guided the schools and parents to develop a formula which was used to contribute to the grain bank; food being consumed by the pupils for lunch in the project schools. Each pupil, through their parents contributes 4kg of beans and 6kg of maize each term, which is on average, covers a period of three (3) months. This participation in project implementation is important for project sustainability. These developments were also reflected in the Millennium project report (2005) as some of the activities in project implementation. The report declares that since its implementation, the SMP has steadily expanded. As at 2014, all the schools in the division were running a school meals program, though experiencing some challenges. A kitchen was developed by the stakeholders in each school, hence provided necessary space and conditions to prepare food for the pupils. The financial, human and material support to run the meals project was a shared responsibility between the community through the parents and the MVP. Food stuff was provided by the MVP and the community. The parents provided three (6) kg of maize and four (4) kg of beans for each pupil per term. The respondents, including pupil, head teachers, parents and teachers informed that parents were charged a fee of between Kshs 60 and Kshs 100 per pupil per term. The fee charged varied from school to school and it was arrived at in a consultative meeting between parents and teachers. How the money collected is also discussed in the meeting. The issues discussed in the minutes of the consultative meetings were captured in minutes which were availed during the data collection process. Consultation of and participation by all stakeholders is important to minimiz” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 18)“MANUSCRIPT ON EVALUATION OF PRIMARY SCHOOL FEEDING PROGRAM SUBMITTED TO EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING 19 conflict and misunderstanding hence ensure project sustainability. The money was used to run the SMP including pay the monthly salary of cooks who work in the kitchen, preparing and serving food to pupils. This shows parents involvement in the implementation of the SMP. This is in line with one of the principles of the project; participation and cost sharing between the project and the community, (UN Millennium project report, 2005).” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 19)“Capacity building of the project stakeholders Parents said that they had attended in-service training workshops to guide them effectively implement the school meals project. This is an indicator that most parents had been capacity built to implement the project. However, one of the parents said that he had not attended a training workshop. Most head teachers (5) and the AEO informed that they had attended in service training workshops on project implementation. All the 3 project staff members who took part in the study as well as twelve teachers had attended at least one workshop to help them implement the school meals project. Most of the teachers selected to participate in the study were responsible for guiding their colleagues in their respective schools in implementing the project. The respondents who reported that they had attended the in-service training workshop were then asked to indicate to what extent the workshop had equipped them with skills to adequately implement the school meals project. The majority of parents (12) who attended the training workshops informed that they had been equipped with requisite knowledge and skills to help them implement the project. Head teachers said that the in-service training workshop had equipped them with knowledge and skills to adequately manage and implement the school meals project. Som” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 19)“MANUSCRIPT ON EVALUATION OF PRIMARY SCHOOL FEEDING PROGRAM SUBMITTED TO EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING 20 of the skills they aquired include record eeping of the food received from parents as well as the food cooked daily. They aalso received knowledge on finance and accounting. This was critical in the management of the SMP. The respondents informed that some of the knowledge and skills acquired in the training workshop included the importance of being involved in the project implementation as well as the roles of the various stakeholders, which in the long run reduces conflict between project players. The stakeholders were also enlightened on the importance of participating in the decision making process involving the SMP. The participatory model of the decision making process promotes ownership of decisions made as well as increased probability of adhering to the decisions made by the stakeholders (Ouda \& Ndung’u, 2016).). Other areas that the stakeholders have been capacity built also include food storage, management of resources, rain water harvesting and time management. They also acquired knowledge on how to participate in the tendering process and the importance of parental and community involvement in the tendering process of foods for the SMP through a project implementation committee.” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 20)“The pupils who participated in the FGDs informed the researcher of their awareness that some of their parents had attended training workshops and therefore were aware of the importance of their participation in the SMP activities This is a clear indication that the project stakeholders had been trained to a greater extent to effectively implement the school meals project despite there being some variations in their responses” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 20)“Availability and adequacy of elements of SMP in schools The evaluator observed that most of the foodstuffs like vegetables, salt and cooking fat required in the implementation of the SMP were available in all the project schools. However, others including maize, beans and fruits and amenities like the cooking pot, which are necessary to run the project, were available but not adequate in some of the project schools. It was also observed that the project schools had a lockable store where they kept the available essentials in the implementation of the meals project. This was mainly for safe keeping” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 21)“Conclusion The study found that to a great extent, project had been effectively implemented. There was an area designated for cooking in each of the schools that are implementing the project. There was evidence of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) in the project schools. This was evidence to show that the training conducted for the stakeholders was being utilized in project implementation. It was observed that most of the foodstuffs like vegetables, salt and cooking fat needed in the project implementation were available in all the project schools. However, others including maize, beans and fruits and amenities like the cooking pot, which are necessary to run the project, were available but not adequate in a few of the project schools. Majority of the school meals project stakeholders, that is, parents, head teachers and project staff had attended in-service training workshops which equipped them with requisite knowledge and skills to implement the school meals project. It was evident tjhat the knowledge aquired during the training was being utilized to ensure project effectiveness. Most of the project stakeholders expressed enthusiasm over the meals project except for a few cases of disapproval. The project had not only created employment for the community, but also when the pupils attended school; they were assured of at least one hot decent balanced meal in a day. The project had also contributed to increased enrollment and improved academic performance. Therefore, the project activities as well as outcomes had led to the deduction that the general attitude of the parents, head teachers, pupils, project staff and the AEO towards the schoo” (Ouda et al., 2019, p. 26)“MANUSCRIPT ON EVALUATION OF PRIMARY SCHOOL FEEDING PROGRAM SUBMITTED TO EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING 27 meals project is positive.

	abstract = {Objective: This study assessed the impacts of the Dekthai Kamsai programme on overweight/obesity, underweight and stunting among male and female primary school students. Study design: A quasi-experiment was conducted in 16 intervention and 19 control schools across Thailand in 2018 and 2019. In total, 896 treated and 1779 control students from grades 1 to 3 were recruited. In intervention schools, a set of multifaceted intervention components were added into school routine practices. Anthropometric outcomes were measured at baseline and at the beginning and end of every school term. Methods: Propensity score matching with linear and Poisson difference-in-difference analyses were used to adjust for the non-randomisation and to analyse the intervention's effects over time. Results: Compared with controls, the increases in mean BMI-for-age Z-score (BAZ) and the incidence rate of overweight/obesity were lower in the intervention schools at the 3rd, 4th and 8th measurements and the 3rd measurement, respectively. The decrease in mean height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) was lower at the 4th measurement. The decrease in the incidence rate of wasting was lower at the 5th, 7th and 8th measurements. The favourable impacts on BAZ and HAZ were found in both sexes, while the favourable impact on overweight/obesity and unfavourable impact on wasting were found in girls. Conclusions: This intervention might be effective in reducing BAZ, overweight/obesity, poor height gain, but not wasting. These findings highlight the benefits of a multifaceted school nutrition intervention and a need to incorporate tailor-made interventions for wasting to comprehensively address the double burden of malnutrition.

“The programme strengthened the schools' capacity to implement eight synergistic components, as detailed in Table S1. Broadly, they were related to 1) healthy food provision; 2) school farm and garden; 3) health and nutritional status monitoring; 4) school cooperatives and vocational training; 5) personal health and hygiene promotion; 6) school sanitation; 7) basic health service; and 8) agriculture, nutrition and health education. The intervention schools were required to be competent in implementing the ‘healthy food provision’ and ‘health and nutritional status monitoring’ components. Other components were complementary components. The implementation strategies of these components were adaptable to suit the schools' contexts, for example, schools are allowed to provide local food menus with equivalent nutritional values to standard school meals and choose traditional dances or active plays over common sports to promote students' physical activity. Each intervention school formed a working group to integrate these components into the school's routine practices and communicate with class teachers who engaged the students in the programme implementation. Training courses, materials and onsite visits were provided to support the teachers, students and parents” (Pongutta et al., 2023, p. 53)
“the effect size of the Dekthai Kamsai programme on students' BAZ was greater than the pooled effect of 12 multicomponent school nutrition programmes implemented in Asia during the past decade ( 0.190, 0.220, 0.246, 0.239 and 0.307 vs. 0.07).7 Among these previous 12 school nutrition programmes, six interventions significantly reduced students' BAZ with effect sizes ranging from 0.03 to 0.14.21e26 Similar to the Dekthai Kamsai programme, the previous interventions were multicomponent interventions; however, they differed in terms of the number of components and intervention intensity. In general, the previous interventions focused on either physical activity and nutrition education or healthy food provision and nutrition education, whereas the more comprehensive Dekthai Kamsai programme aimed at improving physical activity, the provision of healthy school lunches, nutrition education, school sanitation and the school's capacity for monitoring and addressing malnutrition. Likewise, the level of physical activity implemented in the Dekthai Kamsai programme (i.e. 30-min per day of moderate to vigorous activity) was more intense than that implemented in five other programmes.2” (Pongutta et al., 2023, p. 55)
“The Dekthai Kamsai programme consisted of components that had been identified as key components for school-based obesity tackling by previous studies. Meta-analyses of school nutrition interventions confirm that physical activity, even as a single component, reduced children's BMI or BAZ, and that school gardening increased fruit and vegetable consumption among school-aged children.6,7,27,28 School gardening and fun physical activities also increased the time spent in physical activity of moderate-to-vigorous intensity among school-aged children.29e31 Two meta-analyses found that integrating agriculture, nutrition and health education into curricula increases the effectiveness of school-based nutrition interventions.6,31 Real-time outcome monitoring was a key success factor of a successful adaptive community-based nutrition intervention32 and a well-functioning feedback loop plays an important role in improving school-based nutrition interventions.33 For diet interventions, the results are inconsistent, which might reflect the wide range of services in different school-based interventions.7 Not all previous interventions provided school meals that met nutritional standards,7 whereas those following dietary guidelines and school meal standards were effective.34 The school lunches provided in the Dekthai Kamsai programme met one-third of the recommended nutrient reference values of children. Nevertheless, our findings suggested that one healthy school meal was not sufficient to address wasting in the intervention schools. Although our study adds to the current body of evidence that a combination of the Dekthai Kamsai components improved children's BMI, BAZ and HAZ and reduced the incidence rate of overweight and obesity, the contribution of individual components is unknown” (Pongutta et al., 2023, p. 55)
“This finding is consistent with the finding from a recent cross-sectional study11 that the impact on overnutrition of the Dekthai Kamsai programme was not sustainable in dropped-out schools. Secondly, the differences were statistically significant after the first school term for BAZ (at the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th and 8th measurements) and HAZ (at the 4th measurement). This finding shows that this complex school nutrition intervention, in a semi-urban and mixed socio-economic status context, needs more than one school term to show significant changes.” (Pongutta et al., 2023, p. 56)

	abstract = {Objective: Although the majority of Canadian provinces have indicated that they have adopted new school nutrition policies, there have been few if any systematic evaluations of these policies. In Prince Edward Island, a nutrition policy for elementary schools was adopted province-wide in 2006. In the present study, we assessed the nutritional benefits of the new policy by examining changes in student food consumption prior to and one year following implementation of the policy.
Methods: We surveyed fifth and sixth grade children from 11 elementary schools in Prince Edward Island in 2001/02 (pre-policy implementation) and fifth and sixth grade children from the same 11 schools in 2007 (post-policy implementation). Food consumption was assessed using a self-administered validated food frequency questionnaire. We applied multilevel logistic regression to compare pre-/post-policy implementation differences in the proportion of students meeting Canada's Food Guide recommendations for vegetables and fruit (VF) and milk and alternatives (MA) and in the proportion of students consuming {\textless}3 servings of low nutrient dense foods (LNDF) daily.
Results: Relative to students in 2001/02, students surveyed in 2007 were 2.14 (95\% CI 1.62-2.82) times more likely to report consuming less than three daily servings of LNDF and were more likely to meet recommendations for VF (OR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.00-2.07) and MA (OR 1.27, 95\% CI 0.98-1.64).
Conclusion: The present study is the first in Canada to show favourable changes in student food consumption that parallel the introduction of a school nutrition policy.},

The SHI corresponds to the eight components of a coordinated school health program; nutrition services are just one of the eight components. The SHI is a tool that can be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the nutrition program. It covers items from healthy, low-fat choices to food preparation and cafeteria practices.

	abstract = {To increase opportunities for healthy eating and physical activity, US school districts participating in the National School Lunch Program were required to create a Local Wellness Policy (LWP) by June 2006. The What's Working project described the initial influence of this mandate on nutrition environments and policies. In 2005 and 2007 (before and after the mandate went into effect), a survey about school features related to nutrition and physical activity was sent to a random sample of 45 low-income, rural elementary foodservice managers and principals. Schools averaged 204 students, 27\% Hispanic. Districts' LWPs were coded for strength and comprehensiveness. In addition, key informant interviews were conducted with foodservice managers almost 2 years after the LWP went into effect. Three improvements were observed: increases in the percent of schools with policies stipulating predominantly healthy items be offered in classroom parties (21.4\% in 2005 vs 48.7\% in 2007), daily fresh fruit offerings in the lunchroom (0.80 choices in 2005 vs 1.15 choices in 2007), and the percent of schools using skinless poultry (27\% in 2005 vs 59\% in 2007). LWPs were weakly worded and rarely addressed energy content. Nutrition guideline elements most commonly addressed included vending machines, school stores, and à la carte food offerings. Seveny-three percent of foodservice managers were familiar with their district's LWP but did not perceive it changed lunchroom practices. Although LWPs offer a framework to support opportunities for healthy eating, few evidence-based practices were implemented as a direct result of the mandate.

We searched Web of Science, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, Econlit, APA PsycInfo, and Social Policy and Practice for English articles published from January 2000 to January 2021. We quantified the pooled effects of the interventions on the changes in body mass index (BMI) and body mass index z score (BAZ), overall and by type of intervention. In total, 28 articles were included for this review, of which 20 articles were multi-component interventions. Twenty-seven articles were childhood obesity studies and were included for meta-analysis. Overall, school nutrition interventions reduced school-aged children’s BMI and BAZ. Multi-component interventions reduced the children’s BMI and BAZ, whereas physical activity interventions reduced only BMI and nutrition education did not change BMI or BAZ. Overweight/obesity reduction interventions provided a larger effect than prevention interventions. Parental involvement and a healthy food provision did not strengthen school nutrition interventions, which may be due to an inadequate degree of implementation. These results suggested that school nutrition interventions should employ a holistic multi-component approach and ensure adequate stakeholder engagement as well as implementation to maximise the effects. © 2022 by the authors.

Two studies provided nutrition education and healthy meals including whole grains [50] and healthy snacks [45]. One study provided nutrition education and participatory eating events/campaigns [27]. Among the single-component interventions, five studies provided nutrition education [39,41,43,44,52] and three studies implemented extra exercise sessions [33,34,37] (see Table S2).” (Pongutta et al., 2022, p. 5)“the overall effects described in this study are the effectiveness of the school nutrition interventions in reducing BMI or BAZ” (Pongutta et al., 2022, p. 6)“scussion Our findings suggest that, in general, primary school nutrition interventions implemented in different Asian countries significantly reduced BMI and BAZ among schoolaged children. However, the effectiveness varies with certain characteristics of the interventions. In terms of intervention components, multi-component interventions showed significant reductions for both BMI and BAZ, while single-component interventions showed a significant reduction only for BMI. In addition, multi-component interventions had a stronger effect than single-component interventions in reducing BMI. Among the single-component interventions, extra exercise sessions significantly reduced the BMI of the children, while nutrition education did not. In terms of intervention aim, overweight/obesity treatment provided stronger effects in reducing BMI and BAZ than overweight/obesity prevention interventions. Involving parents in the interventions did not significantly strengthen the effectiveness of the interventions” (Pongutta et al., 2022, p. 10)“Across all types of intervention, multi-component school nutrition interventions are the best option that provide consistent and strongest impacts in addressing childhood overnutrition” (Pongutta et al., 2022, p. 12)

Within each region, a specific program is evaluated for growth in the designated metrics. Based on statistical and qualitative findings, conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of various programs in their respective socioeconomic regions, and further recommendations for program implementation are given” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 100)“School feeding programs (SFPs) are implemented in most countries around the world and seek to “reduce hunger among school children so that hunger is not an obstacle to their development” [2]. Hunger and poverty are prevalent in both high-income and low-income countries. Hunger is a solvable problem that school feeding programs aim to address. A successful SFP can achieve some or all of the following: • Provide a social safety net for families • Alleviate hunger, improving nutrition and cognition • Stimulate the local economy • Use education to improve community health status • Provide school-centered community development • Increase local food production and food security • Improve social stability and empower women • Encourage educational attainment” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 100)“In the United States, Chicago was selected for the high income urban area because it has recently invested in an ambitious school feeding program. The city has committed to offering free meals to every student, purchasing local food, creating a healthy food culture, building community engagement and feedback, and growing food in school gardens [10]. This comprehensive school feeding program is a good representation of what is possible for regions that have both significant, available funding and a willingness to invest in school meals. It is also one of the most densely populated cities in the United States, so it should be an example of school feeding program structure in urban areas [11]” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 101)“UGANDA From 2006-2010, the World Food Programme ran a school feeding initiative where they provided 40,895 tons of food to Uganda’s Karamoja region, costing about \$25 million. This program, alongside bettering childhood nutrition, aimed to reduce the gender gap, especially in secondary schools” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 102)“When analyzing the program’s success, there were marked improvements in attendance and overall educational attainment. Attendance of girls in both primary and secondary school saw increases in Karamoja that were significantly higher than that of the Eastern region, and trends in male attendance followed a similar pattern. Female educational attainment in Karamoja also greatly improved relative to Eastern. There was a 14\% decrease in the number of women in Karamoja with no education while only a 7\% drop in Eastern. With regards to literacy, both male and female rates increased at least 10\% in Karamoja while remaining relatively steady in Eastern. Finally, female empowerment in Karamoja increased, as 13\% more women felt in charge of household decisions. This same metric decreased 4\% in the Eastern region. Nutritionally, there were similar levels of improvement in both regions. Nutritional status and prevalence of anemia did decrease in Karamoja. However, there were comparable decreases in the Eastern region as well [18]-[19]. Overall, this program was successful in a few isolated areas. However, due to its length of only 4 years, there is doubt that the program will have any significant, long-term impacts. There were many limitations to this analysis. With regards to data, some increases may be due to the fact that the baseline for improvement in Karamoja was lower than in the Eastern region. For example, it is easier to improve a 20\% literacy rate than a 90\% one. Also, the groups surveyed are not consistent with the program. The educational attainment metric was for women aged 15-49, so it may be a lagging indicator of successful initiatives in the past. The nutritional status of children was only for those under the age of 5, which may have not been directly targeted by the SFP. With regards to the program itself, there was not much information on the logistics, strategy, and implementation. Overall, due to these limitations, further analyses must be done before concrete conclusions about the low-income rural SFP can be drawn.” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 102)“HAITI Due to both the large number of organizations working on school feeding in Haiti, as well as the frequent occurrence of natural disasters, the quantitative data available for comparisons between years are not only spotty, but also have an additional bias in terms of the ability of the program to function as intended due to frequent, dramatic disruptions. Because of this, the team chose to move forward with a more qualitative analysis of Haiti.” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 102)“In contrast with other low-income countries, Haiti has a national institution regulating school feeding” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 102)“The frequent occurrence of natural disasters has been a major deterrent to productive agriculture and sustained, domestically-driven SFP in Haiti. In 2009, Haiti finished the year on a very optimistic note: “a bumper harvest, improved food security indicators, a strong focus on supporting investments to accelerate economic growth” [15]. However, on January 12th, 2010 an earthquake brought “death, 10” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 102)“devastation, and the risk of a major national food and nutrition crisis, that left Haiti dependent on massive national and international efforts to deploy a humanitarian safety net on which Haiti’s resilience could bounce” [15]. In January of 2013, three years following the devastating earthquake, a drought, Tropical Storm Isaac, and Hurricane Sandy destroyed harvests and left Haiti to struggle with the first major food security crisis since the earthquake [15]. Even with the support of major organizations and wellestablished school feeding initiatives, disruptive events such as these have left Haiti dependent on outside help. It appears that these natural disasters are significant factors in Haiti’s inability to shift to self-sustainable feeding programs. Furthermore, these natural disasters likely contribute to the inconsistency of data reporting on the nation’s school feeding programs. Additionally, some of the spottiness in data reporting is due to poor coordination across the large number of organizations supporting school feeding programs in Haiti. Thus, extreme poverty, a lack of resources, frequent natural disasters, and poor coordination across multiple external aid organizations makes it difficult for Haiti to develop an independent, sustained SFP or to collect and report the data necessary for effective program assessment. In times of prosperity, linking Haitian agriculture to procurement for its SFPs could help to stimulate the local economy, but better coordination across aid organizations and a robust plan for data collection, reporting, and program assessment, are also necessary for independent, selfsustaining SFPs. Due to these limitations, a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of SFP in low-income urban setting could not be made on the basis of our analysis in Haiti.” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 103)“GEORGIA The Farm-to-School Program (F2S) is designed to enable students to gain access to healthy local foods and education opportunities. Activities promoted within the program include access to school gardens, cooking lessons, and farm field trips” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 103)“In Georgia, all of the school districts have some form of an SFP [13]. Therefore, in order to draw conclusions about the success of the F2S Program, two implementations of the same program in different Georgia public school counties are compared. One implementation includes the schools in the rural Burke County (BCPS), and the other includes more urban schools located in the city of Atlanta (APS).” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 103)“he implementation of the F2S Program in Burke County focuses a lot on incorporating local food in school meals and fostering education about healthy food and where it comes from. This can be seen by BCPS having a higher number of student-farmer interactions per school, days with local food on the menu, meals with local food per students, and hands-on cooking activities per school. Despite BCPS having these higher numbers, APS saw a more positive change between 2014 and 2016 for student-farmer interactions per school, days with local food on the menu, and meals with local food per students. In contrast to BCPS’ strengths, the Atlanta Public Schools focused more on community engagement and professional development. This can be seen by the higher number of professional development activities and activities with community engagement. However, although APS had a higher number of professional development activities, BCPS performed better in terms of improvement from 2014 to 2016. BPCS also contains fewer schools than APS, which may account for the lower number of professional 10” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 103)“development activities and activities with community engagemen” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 104)“In 2011, Chicago Public Schools invested in an extensive school meals program that surpasses national standards [25][26].” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 104)“Chicago’s school meals program has had a tangible effect on student achievement, attendance, and persistence” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 104)“Since implementing the program, attendance in schools has improved across the board and the effect is significant at every grade level. Elementary and middle school grade levels reported between a 0.32\% and 0.77\% increase in attendance, with p values from {\textasciitilde}0 to 0.049. High schools grade levels reported between a 3.52 and 4.29 percent increase in attendance, with p values all lower than 0.01. Additionally, elementary test scores have increased dramatically. Students meeting or exceeding expectations in reading rose 4.7\%, in math rose 6.3\%, and in science rose 7.9\%, all with p values {\textasciitilde}0. High school scores have remained largely stagnant, however, with no significant change in scores. Persistence of students has improved as well; the oneyear dropout rate dropped by 1.9\% three years after implementation with a p value of 0.04, and the freshmen on track rate rose 7.13\% with a p value of 0.004. In addition, suspension rates have fallen across the board, especially in high school with a drop of 14.9\%. However, nutrition benefits are less conclusive. The only data available was city wide in FDA studies, so we could only look for large scale change. Students reporting drinking one or more sodas per day decreased by 6.3\% after sodas were removed from vending machines, but high school students did not report eating more fruits and vegetables. Obesity rates for kindergarten fell 0.9\% and for 6th grade fell 0.4\%, but in 9th grade rose 0.5\%. Chicago has improved student retention and attendance at all grade levels and achievement for young students, but there has been little change in student health. It is unclear whether the city’s large investment in healthier meals has been worth it from a nutritional standpoint. However, academic metrics show a successful program.” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 104)“CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK School feeding programs have the potential to foster child education, and have the ability to provide an economic benefit to communities by impacting the agricultural sector. 10” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 104)“However, SFPs need an objective assessment and evaluation process to measure success. This project aimed to evaluate programs in four main socio-economic categories: Low Income Rural, Low Income Urban, High Income Rural, and High Income Urban. The results found that there are five major types of implementation methods for SFPs, but the data collection is inconsistent, making comparative assessment difficult. In High Income Countries (HIC), the objectives for SFPs are different from the stated objectives by the World Food Programme, who tend to focus more on Low Income Countries (LIC). Besides a lack of clarity on the success of nutrition, HIC found that school feeding programs were effective in their stated objectives. In the LIC, it is difficult to come to any definitive conclusions based on the stated objectives. In the case of Haiti, there is a lack of consistency across the different types of programs because they are managed by many different external aid agencies. Qualitative assessment shows they have the potential to obtain these benefits, but the lack of coordination and disruptive natural disasters make it impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs. In the case of Karamoja, there is evidence that the program does have some positive impacts on nutrition and educational attainment. However, the length of the program and the lack of data on schoolaged children make it difficult to directly evaluate the impacts of the program. Given the ability of SFPs to foster human development, there must be more consistent objectives and evaluation criteria that allow for both assessment of individual programs, as well as assessment across multiple programs. This will help determine the best and the worst SFPs and will foster improvement. In addition, when multiple aid agencies are involved, it is vital to implement better coordination across agencies, and a robust plan for data collection and reporting. Future work on this project should focus on determining the robust program assessment and evaluation tools” (Aroesty et al., 2018, p. 105)

	abstract = {Objective: Implementation of school meal guidelines is often inadequate, and evidence for effective implementation strategies for school-based nutrition interventions is limited. The aim of the present study was to examine the implementation and effectiveness of a multi-strategy implementation intervention to increase adherence to the Norwegian national school meal guideline. Design: The study was a school-based hybrid implementation effectiveness trial with a pre-post non-equivalent control group design, testing three implementation strategies: internal facilitation, training and an educational meeting. Setting: Primary schools and after-school services in two counties in south-east Norway. Participants: School principals, after-school leaders and class teachers from thirty-three schools in the intervention county and principals and after-school leaders from thirty-four schools in a comparison county. Results: There was a significant difference of 4 percentage points in change scores between the intervention and the comparison groups at follow-up, after adjusting for baseline adherence (B = 0·04, se B = 0·01, t = 3·10, P = 0·003). The intervention effect was not associated with the school's socio-economic profile. School-level fidelity was the implementation dimension that was most strongly correlated (r s = 0·48) with the change scores in the intervention group, indicating that principals' support is important for gaining the largest intervention effects. Conclusions: A school-based intervention with low intensity, based on trained teachers as internal facilitators, can increase adherence to the national school meal guideline among Norwegian primary schools, irrespective of local socio-economic conditions. Implementation fidelity, at an organisational level, may be a useful predictor for intervention outcomes in schools.  © The Author(s), 2024.

“A school-based intervention with low intensity, based on trained teachers as internal facilitators, can increase adherence to the national school meal guideline among Norwegian primary schools, irrespective of local socio-economic conditions. Implementation fidelity, at an organisational level, may be a useful predictor for intervention outcomes in schools.” (Randby et al., 2024, p. 1)“However, in a nation-wide, quantitative school meal survey in 2013, some barriers to guideline implementation in Norwegian primary schools were identified,” (Randby et al., 2024, p. 2)“including low guideline awareness among both principals and after-school leaders, unhealthy packed lunches and poor eating facilities. Low guideline adherence was evidenced by a high proportion of schools offering too little time to eat and a low proportion of after-school services offering fruit and vegetables daily(10,26).Furthermore, low priority for social mealtimes has been identified among primary school teachers in a Norwegian study(27).Ina previous formative study in this project, identified barriers included weak administrative leadership linked to school meals, the lack of a school culture around meal practices, a noisy classroom climate undermining social meals and difficulties with teacher–parent collaboration concerning packed lunches(28). Furthermore, after-school staff were largely unfamiliar with the guideline, had low formal competency in meal planning and food preparation, and operated without much influence or support from the school principal.” (Randby et al., 2024, p. 2)“hree implementation strategies were employed to form the multi-strategy implementation intervention: internal facilitators as agents of practice change at their own school (teachers appointed as food ambassadors); educational meeting for all participants (principals, food ambassadors and after-school leaders); and training of food ambassadors and after-school leaders. These are consistent with three strategies (33, 15 and 19) in the ERIC project, all of which are rated as among the most promising strategies due to high feasibility and importance(19). The external facilitators delivering the intervention were the first author (public health nutritionist), a senior adviser at the Norwegian Directorate of Health (clinical dietitian) and the two MOVE project leaders (one teacher and one public health nutritionist).” (Randby et al., 2024, p. 4)“Several practice changes linked with the adherence increase in the intervention group were evident, of which the largest changes during school hours were more time to eat, improved availability of cold drinking water, reduced access to chocolate and snacks, better hand-washing” (Randby et al., 2024, p. 9)“practices, and better access to fruit and vegetables. For meal practices during the after-school service, the largest changes were reduced access to beverages with added sugar or sweeteners, improved food safety practices, variety of warm dishes of meat, fish, and vegetarian options, reduced access to chocolate and snacks, healthier bread toppings, and reduced access to sugary and high-fat baked goods. More details are available (see Additional file 7).” (Randby et al., 2024, p. 9)

The findings show no evidence of any effects on child body weight” (Von Hinke Kessler Scholder, 2013, p. 538)“This study explores the extent to which the state provision of school meals in the 1980s crowded out private provision by examining two policy reforms that radically altered the UK school meal service. The first, in 1980, increased the price of school meals; the second, in 1988, reduced the eligibility for free lunches. Using a DD approach, I show that the reforms caused a substantial behavioural change among those affected. Both reforms reduced the school meal take-up by 20–30 percentage points among the treated, leaving the controls unaffected. With that, the consumption of packed and home lunches rose dramatically, providing direct evidence of school meal crowd out, and of parents substituting school meals with packed and home lunches. With a clear change in the type of lunch consumed, I next examine whether the reforms had any effect on different measures of child body weight. The results, however, show no effects on children’s body weight for either of the two reforms. This analysis has several limitations. First, although the results show no effects of the reforms on child body weight, there may have been other advantages of the government-provided school meals that I cannot examine here, such as better academic attainment (see e.g. Belot and James, 2011). Second, the government-subsidised meals may have affected individuals’ health later in life, or it may have affected other health or nutritional outcomes. Unfortunately, due to data limitations, I cannot examine these here. With that, it is important to note that the analyses do not suggest that reforms had no effects on children and their families. Third, because the reforms affected children above the bottom of the income distribution, the data do not allow me to explore the effects of the Acts on the most disadvantaged children. With that, I cannot make any inferences about the effects on the poor in society, or about whether there is some income threshold, above which there is no need for government intervention. Furthermore, as these data are arguably not representative of today’s society due to the large changes in the nutritional environment since the 1980s, I do not wish to extrapolate these results to the current context. Instead, I argue that the analyses shed light on two important issues. First, on the extent to which there are offsetting responses by households to government policies. Indeed, the data provide a unique opportunity to explore individuals changing their behaviour in response to government interventions. Second, despite the substantial behavioural response to the government-introduced price increase of school meals, the data show no evidence that this affected children’s body weights.” (Von Hinke Kessler Scholder, 2013, p. 544)

	abstract = {Wellness in the Schools (WITS) is a national non-profit organization partnering with public schools to provide healthy, scratch cooked, less processed meals (called an Alternative Menu), and active recess. This study examined the effects of WITS programming on school lunch consumption, including fruit and vegetable intake, in second and third grade students in New York City public schools serving a high proportion of students from low-income households. The intervention was evaluated with a quasi-experimental, controlled design with 14 elementary schools (7 that had initiated WITS programming in fall 2015 and were designated as intervention schools, and 7 matched Control schools). School lunch consumption was assessed by anonymous observation using the System of Observational Cafeteria Assessment of Foods Eaten (SOCAFE) tool in the fall of 2015 (Time 0, early intervention) and the spring of 2016 (Time 1) and 2017 (Time 2). There were no baseline data. Data were also collected on the types of entrées served in the months of October, January, and April during the two school years of the study. Across time points, and relative to students in the Control schools, students in WITS schools ate more fruits and vegetables (units = cups): Time 0: Control 0.18 vs. WITS 0.28; Time 1: Control 0.25 vs. WITS 0.31; and Time 2: Control 0.19 vs. WITS 0.27; p {\textless} 0.001. They also had more fruits and vegetables (cups) on their trays, which included more vegetables from the salad bar. However, students in the WITS schools ate fewer entrées (grain and protein) and drank less milk than students in the Control schools. Compared to the Control schools, WITS schools offered more homestyle entrées and fewer finger foods and sandwich entrees, i.e., less processed food. Students in WITS schools who received the Alternative menu and all of the WITS programming at all data collection time points selected and consumed more fruits and vegetables. Replication studies with randomized designs and true baseline data are needed to confirm these findings and to identify avenues for strengthening the effects of the program on other school lunch components. © 2021 by the authors.

This study examined the effects of WITS programming on school lunch consumption, including fruit and vegetable intake, in second and third grade students in New York City public schools serving a high proportion of students from low-income households” (Koch et al., 2021, p. 1)“Across time points, and relative to students in the Control schools, students in WITS schools ate more fruits and vegetables (units = cups): Time 0: Control 0.18 vs. WITS 0.28; Time 1: Control 0.25 vs. WITS 0.31; and Time 2: Control 0.19 vs. WITS 0.27; p {\textless} 0.001.

Students in WITS schools who received the Alternative menu and all of the WITS programming at all data collection time points selected and consumed more fruits and vegetables” (Koch et al., 2021, p. 1)“There were two major components of the WITS programming: (1) Cook for Kids and (2) Coach for Kids. Cook for Kids partnered trained culinary school graduates (called WITS Cooks) with cafeteria staff to: (a) transition the school from the standard menu offered by the Office of Food and Nutrition Services (OFNS) to the Alternative menu that WITS created with OFNS (i.e., daily scratch cooked meals and less processed entrées), (b) add or expand the salad bar, (c) eliminate chocolate milk as a beverage option, and (d) add a waterjet station if the school did not already have one. The WITS Cooks were a presence in the school cafeteria and encouraged students to eat the school lunch, as well as to take and eat vegetables from the salad bar. Through WITS Labs and WITS Bits, a series of seasona” (Koch et al., 2021, p. 2)“Nutrients 2021, 13, 3085 3 of 11 cooking and nutrition classes, the WITS Cooks taught children and families how to prepare and cook healthy, tasty, and affordable meals with whole and less processed foods. All the classes in all the WITS schools received four WITS Labs each school year of the intervention. WITS Bits are short 20 min lessons that were offered to the schools. The number of WITS Bits lessons the classes in the WITS schools received was not recorded. The WITS Cook was at the school and interacted with the students every school day during the first school year of the study and was present and interacted with the students three days a week during the second school year of the study in all the schools. Any NYC public school could adopt the Alternative Menu. However, only schools who were working with WITS would have the WITS Cook, the WITS Labs, and WITS Bits. Coach for Kids used trained fitness professionals to work with students during school recess (both indoors and outdoors) to transform recess from a time of sedentary socializing to a time of increased physical activity and teamwork. As part of Coach for Kids, the students were empowered and supported during recess with WITS anti-bullying initiatives through the teaching of pro-social behaviors. For the purposes of this study, we focused on if and how WITS programming changed school lunch consumption.” (Koch et al., 2021, p. 3)“This study demonstrated that WITS programming made significant changes to the consumption of school lunch. Even though this study used a non-randomized design, the schools in the Control group had similar demographics to the schools which were receiving WITS programming. This study was not designed to determine how different parts of WITS programming affected students school lunch consumption. However, it seems likely that the differences found were due to the differences between the standard and the Alternative menu. The differences found for the three outcomes (fruits and vegetables, entrées, and milk) were similar across all three data collection time points. For the WITS schools, Time 0 was during the first weeks of the transition to the Alternative menu and the receipt of WITS programming, and Time 1 and Time 2 were one and two school years after the transition to the Alternative menu. For fruits and vegetables, students in the WITS schools consumed 41\% more than students in the Control schools. The difference between students in the Control and WITS schools was smallest at Time 1, when students in both the Control and WITS schools had their highest level of fruit and vegetable consumption.” (Koch et al., 2021, p. 7)

	abstract = {Research is limited on added sugars in school meals and children’s dietary intakes after the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommended that added sugars be limited to less than 10\% of total calories. This analysis uses data from the School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study (SNMCS) to examine levels of added sugars in: (1) school meals and (2) children’s dietary intakes at breakfast, lunch, and over 24 h on school days. SNMCS data were collected in the 2014–2015 school year after updated nutrition standards for school meals were implemented. Most schools exceeded the DGA limit for added sugars at breakfast (92\%), while 69\% exceeded the limit at lunch. The leading source of added sugars in school meals (both breakfasts and lunches) was flavored skim milk. More than 62\% of children consumed breakfasts that exceeded the DGA limit, and almost half (47\%) consumed lunches that exceeded the limit. Leading sources of added sugars in the breakfasts consumed by children were sweetened cold cereals and condiments and toppings; leading sources of added sugars in children’s lunches were flavored skim milk and cake. Over 24 h, 63\% of children exceeded the DGA limit. These findings show that school meals and children’s dietary intakes are high in added sugars relative to the DGA limit and provide insights into the types of foods that should be targeted in order to decrease levels of added sugars. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, the regular nutritional surveillance for school-aged students will be introduced in school system thus we can develop and evaluate the school meal program in terms of nutrients, food safety and nutrition education.” (Trung Le, 2012, p. 139)“INTRODUCTION During the last three decades, the socio-economic status has dramatically developed. Consequently, quality of life of Vietnamese has improved, resulting in changes in disease patterns. Prevalence of undernutrition in children decreased from 51\% to 20\%,1 though its prevalence is still high among school-aged children (approximately 33\%). On the other hand, prevalence of overweight children is also increasing in the same age group.2 In Ho Chi Minh City, one of the biggest and industrialized city, the prevalence of undernutrition has been significantly decreasing over time (Figure 1).3 Beside the social development, the increased variety of foods, easier assessment of dietary intake and adequate food supply play an important role in improvement of nutritional status of children. Most of children, from preschool to school-aged, spend approximately 6 to 8 hours at school where they would have lunch and snack. Children in these age groups have high energy and nutrients requirements. School meal program, therefore, has an important role in dietary intake of children. Positive impacts of school meal program have been documented in other countries. In Japan, height of children became shorter right after the War world II, due to a lack of nutritional supplementation. In order to improve the nutritional status, the school meal program was fully implemented in 1950. The benefits of the program have been well recognized.4,5 In Malaysia, the school nutrition programs (including school feeding program) has been implemented in both government and private schools. The program provided 1/4 to 1/3 of daily requirements, which was applied only to elementary school (aged 6-12 years). By which, health and nutritional status as well as immune function against infectious diseases have improved among poor children.6 In addition, studies in other countries also show that the school lunch program has a important role in providing healthy foods and adequate nutrients,7-11 and is associated with a better educational and nutritional status of school children.12-15 In this manuscript, the author would like to provide a general view of school lunch program in Ho Chi Minh city in the past, present and future direction” (Trung Le, 2012, p. 139)“Although school meals are consistent with RDA and no severe case or death of food poison has been observed, there still is a limitation that we have no official dietitian for school. Kitchen staffs in both school and company are not fully/officially trained for nutrition. The knowledge that they received from short-term training course is very basic, that is, nutrition and food hygiene. In addition, because the training on nutrition is not mandatory and its continued education is optional, this results in that certain kitchen staff have never been trained in nutrition or their knowledge on nutrition is outdate due to non-attendance to the continued education. It is therefore really difficult to achieve successful school meal program with lack of human resources specialized in nutrition” (Trung Le, 2012, p. 141)“Moreover, the problem of the re-evaluation or checking process of meal preparation is that the time span for regular checking is quite long (every two year),18 and the a small portion of school is randomly selected for evaluation, while quite a number of school kitchen perform selfevaluation. It is necessary to have an appropriate surveillance system for monitoring at school. Another limitation of the school meal program is nutrition education is not yet well acknowledged. In other countries, the nutrition education plays an important role in the school program. Pupils could learn basic nutrition and attend field work to understand how the food comes. 5,6,10,14,21-23 These activities are really essential and very useful for the children. Additionally, according to Japanese school meal program, the role of nutritionists and dietitians is very important in implementing nutrition education program for young pupils.24 However, the school meal program in Vietnam still focuses on providing food and the nutritional education is still limited, due to a lack of nutritionist and dietitian.16 According to the National Nutrition Strategy in the period of 2011-2020, one of the principal action plans to improve nutritional status in general focused on increase of body height of Vietnamese children and enhancement of the school nutrition program in which the appropriate school meal program should be essential. The integration of nutrition education into school meal program should be performed more effectively.25 Together with the school meal program, more attention should be paid on human resource development of dietitian and nutritionist” (Trung Le, 2012, p. 141)“Although the school meal program has been implemented since early times in Vietnam, the effects of this program is still limited due to certain difficulties in terms of society and human resource. Under the plan in National Nutrition strategy period 2011-2020, the school meal program and activities to improve nutritional status and knowledge of children has been appropriately invested. It is therefore expected that the nutritional situation in the next generation of Vietnamese will be much improved” (Trung Le, 2012, p. 141)

A total of 604 intervention students from four schools participated in classroom food demonstrations and tasting activities using seven food recipes. The control group included 600 students from two additional schools. Each recipe featured one vegetable from Latino, Hmong, or mainstream American cultures. Intervention students also received food kits containing ingredients to take home for each recipe. Mixed methods of quantitative student and parent pre-post surveys, parent feedback surveys, and qualitative focus groups were used to evaluate the intervention. Generalized estimating equations were used for survey data analysis. Qualitative data from parent focus groups were analyzed based on the principles of grounded theory. Both quantitative and qualitative results revealed that intervention students increased familiarity, preferences, and consumption of the featured vegetables and significantly increased their involvement in food preparation at home. Qualitative results showed that children were actively involved in food preparation at home. In addition, the intervention helped parents increase their appreciation for new foods and recipes.

	abstract = {Background: National Nutritional Standards for school lunches were reintroduced in 2001, and included guidance on portion sizes for primary schools. For the first time since 1997, nationally representative data on school food portion sizes in England have been collected using direct assessment rather than reported portion sizes. Methods: Food portions were weighed directly in foods served in nationally representative samples of primary and secondary school meals. Results were grouped by food or food group. Results: The number of portions weighed was 7975 in primary schools and 3354 in secondary schools. Individual portion weights were grouped by food or food group to yield mean, median, SD and inter-quartile range. For a given food or food group, the number of portions weighed varied from 5 to 210 portions in primary schools and between 5 and 194 portions in secondary schools. Conslusions: The results provide a good representation of typical portion weights for different foods and food groups in primary and secondary schools in England. Portion size is one factor that determines nutrient intake. New standards for school lunches are both nutrient and food-based. Guidance on portion weights will help to ensure that pupils consume the correct balance of foods to obtain the recommended nutrient intake. The present findings complement and extend existing guidance on portion sizes for pupils in schools in England and Scotland. © 2008 The Authors.

“BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: School meals represent the largest sector in Government food procurement in the United Kingdom. This paper aims to quantify, simultaneously, the nutritional quality and carbon footprint of meals provided by primary schools in England. SUBJECTS/METHODS: The School Food Trust conducted the ‘Primary School Food Survey 2009’ in a nationally representative sample of 139 primary schools in England. The survey included 6690 students who consumed school lunches and 3488 students who brought packed lunches. We estimated the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) per Kg of the food items contributing to those lunches based on the results of a systematic review of life-cycle analyses. RESULTS: In both school lunches and packed lunches, the ‘meat, fish and alternatives’ group contributed the largest share of GHGEs. The mean GHGE value per school lunch was estimated to be 0.72 (95\% uncertainty interval 0.52–1.34) KgCO2e and per packed lunch was 0.70 (0.58–0.94) KgCO2e. The total GHGE due to primary school meals in England per year is 578.1 million KgCO2e (455–892 million). CONCLUSIONS: If all children achieved a healthy meal defined by having a low level of salt, free sugars and saturated fat, the total GHGEs from primary school meals would be 441.2 million KgCO2e (384–1192), saving 136.9 million KgCO2e compared with the current total emissions from primary school meals. This paper demonstrates that changes in the primary school food sector can have an impact on UK GHGEs” (Wickramasinghe et al., 2016, p. 1162)“This study found that the total GHGEs due to primary school meals in England is 578.1 million KgCO2e a year, equivalent to 4578 000 economy class return air journeys between London and New York.28 School lunches have a marginally higher GHGE mean value than packed lunches, but the overall emission is higher from packed lunches as more primary school children take packed lunches. The study also investigated whether healthier school meals were associated with less or more GHGEs. When we used a common definition to define healthy meals (lower levels of salt, saturated fat and sugar), results suggest that healthy school lunches and packed lunches are low in GHGEs but are also lower in fibre and some micronutrient levels” (Wickramasinghe et al., 2016, p. 1164)“No previous studies have estimated the carbon footprint of the primary school food sector, in any country. However, a number of studies have estimated the total carbon footprint of the food system in the United Kingdom.8,31,32 These studies have estimated that total GHGEs due to food consumption in the UK is around 95 MtCO2e/year.33 The total emissions from primary school lunches in England, as estimated in this paper, represent about 0.6\% of that, which is to be expected as primary school children represent 6.5\% of the population in the United Kingdom and the school lunch only represents a third of their food intake in 190 days in a year. The literature suggests that policy options should aim to reduce GHGE-intensive meat meals to achieve both environmental goals and health benefits.34 Healthy meals are often considered to be low GHGE intensive.35 There are mixed findings on whether moving to a healthier diet or moving towards recommended dietary guidelines would reduce GHGEs.36 The previous literature has also reported that sometimes, despite containing large amounts of plant-based foods, high nutritional quality diets do not always have the lowest GHGE values.37 Tom et al.38 found that reducing caloric intake levels and shifting current US diet to recommended food patterns based on the US Dietary Guidelines would increase energy use by 38\% and GHGEs by 6\%. The difference in GHGE in healthy and unhealthy meals could be impacted by several factors such as the type of food items and energy levels in the meals, and therefore it is important to consider all these aspects when making recommendations for sustainable healthy diets.” (Wickramasinghe et al., 2016, p. 1166)

	abstract = {School meals make significant contributions to healthy dietary behaviour, at a time when eating habits and food preferences are being formed. We provide an overview of the approaches to the provision, regulation, and improvement of preschool and primary school meals in the UK, Sweden, and Australia, three countries which vary in their degree of centralisation and regulation of school meals. Sweden has a centralised approach; all children receive free meals, and a pedagogical approach to meals is encouraged. Legislation demands that meals are nutritious. The UK system is varied and decentralised. Meals in most primary schools are regulated by food-based standards, but preschool-specific meal standards only exist in Scotland. The UK uses food groups (starchy foods, fruit and vegetables, proteins and dairy) in a healthy plate approach. Australian States and Territories all employ guidelines for school canteen food, predominantly using a “traffic light” approach outlining recommended and discouraged foods; however, most children bring food from home and are not covered by this guidance. The preschool standards state that food provided should be nutritious. We find that action is often lacking in the preschool years, and suggest that consistent policies, strong incentives for compliance, systematic monitoring, and an acknowledgement of the broader school eating environment (including home provided food) would be beneficial. © 2017 by the authors.

“4.3. Australian Reach, Implementation, and Impact of Preschool and School Meals Policies The monitoring and compliance of policy guidelines in schools varies by State/Territory. In general, the policies are not actively enforced or routinely monitored by government. There is variable implementation across the different jurisdictions, and poor rates of adherence” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 11)“Quite different approaches to ensuring school meal quality are taken in the three countries reviewed here. Sweden has almost universal provision and uptake of school meals from preschool through primary years, and a requirement for nutritious meals, but this requirement is not strictly monitored and the guidelines issued for the meals are non-binding” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 12)“In contrast, Australia largely relies on home-provided meals in the primary years supplemented by in-school canteens. National “traffic light” guidance for canteen food in primary schools exists, but implementation is at a state level and adherence is poor. Preschools in Australia have state-specific support for the provision of healthy food, but national standards simply stipulate food and drinks provided must be “nutritious and appropriate”, which makes this standard too vague to be enforceable. The UK uses food-based standards in both the primary and preschool years, but these are only statutory in some contexts. Free school meal uptake is high, but where meals are paid for (including in preschools), the use of home provided meals is common, undermining the positive contribution of food standards to diet. In none of the three countries are the mechanisms for the monitoring of these food standards clearly enforced, limiting our knowledge and potentially limiting impact on diet and health. In both the UK and Australia, there is little regulation and provision for the youngest children” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 12)“Evidence suggests that embedding discussions about healthy eating and exposing children to healthy food choices is likely to be useful in shaping their long term eating preferences” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 12)“Two core weakness emerge, however. The first is that provided school meals are only part of the picture of food consumed during school hours.” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 12)“The nutritional advantages of high quality meal provision are undermined where few children take up this offer and/or where food from other sources is not included in healthy eating plans.” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 12)“Secondly, all three countries appear to have weak mechanisms for monitoring compliance with healthy eating policies, and lack provisions for monitoring children’s actual intake” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 12)“This means that they are unable to comment with certainty on the extent to which schools provide food as envisaged in the policy, and are unable to assess whether policy changes have resulted in improved nutritional intake” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 12)“The implications for school meal policies are that: (a) enforcement of policy is necessary to see improvements; (b) uptake of provided food is crucial to deliver benefits; and (c) monitoring of uptake, nutritional intake, and differential intake by social groups is needed to demonstrate whether provided school food is, in fact, a public health success. Others have reached similar conclusions [4], particularly considering the value of monitoring and evaluation for policy success [99]. Overly burdensome data collection can interfere with policy implementation [51], but light touch regulation, using existing education inspection mechanisms, that requires schools to report on their compliance with guidelines and their uptake of provided food could achieve much with little additional effort. In addition, mechanisms to provide clear accountability for compliance with standards, and strong incentives for compliance (e.g., tied to budget mechanisms, or individual Principal performance assessments) need to be explored. The Swedish self-monitoring tool is working well to encourage quality improvements, and it provides a model for efficient audit.” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 13)“We also need whole-school approaches to healthy eating which are broader than school meals. This should include the consideration of meals and snacks brought from home, but also wider actions to address attitudes towards healthy foods. Banning adults (staff and visitors) from smoking or using tobacco products on the premises or at any school-related activities is a key feature of tobacco free schools [100]. Adopting similar “whole school” approaches to junk-food free schools may be appropriate. Population-level improvements in health need population-level responses, and political and policy actions addressing the food environment are needed [101]. Reductions in the extensive marketing of unhealthy food in children’s immediate environment (fast food outlets and convenience stores) [102], and increases in the relative price of unhealthy compared to healthy food are needed [103], and would support schools in their efforts.” (Lucas et al., 2017, p. 13)

Conclusions: Engaging child nutrition staff and other community partners to plan and implement the FAV5 program in schools is feasible.” (Calancie et al., 2018, p. 289)“With funding from the Kohl’s Cares Foundation, researchers with extensive experience working in school settings developed the following basic components of a program called FAV5: culinary training for child nutrition staff to increase capacity to prepare appealing meals; mini-grants for child nutrition staff to purchase items that promote healthy food choices in their cafeterias; and taste test events at schools to serve as an opportunity for collaboration between child nutrition staff, teachers, and other staff and to demonstrate the potential for such events to elicit enthusiasm for new menu items” (Calancie et al., 2018, p. 290)“CONCLUSIONS The FAV5 program was feasible to implement in seven elementary schools within a school district in North Carolina. Most students reported liking the taste test samples and the child nutrition staff incorporated the new menu items in their future menu rotations. Child nutrition staff enjoyed engaging with the program and reported seeing positive changes in their cafeterias post implementation. Qualitative feedback from child nutrition staff indicated that the FAV5 was viewed positively, but that menu items should be simple to avoid adding too much extra preparation or clean up time. A major success of the project was the development of long-term relationship with the CND that led to HPDP researchers and staff working collaboratively with Orange County Schools on strengthening their school meals program and other nutrition-related initiatives. This study describes the process of engaging child nutrition staff, principals, teachers, and students in a school-based program to increase capacity of the child nutrition program to positively influence participation in the school meals program. Such programs have the potential for increasing the number of students receiving healthy meals through school meals programs.” (Calancie et al., 2018, p. 295)

	abstract = {Aim: The aim of this survey was to assess the feasibility and acceptance of a free breakfast offer (model project “School Breakfast”) at interested primary schools in the city of Bonn, Germany, with a focus on the food offer and framework conditions. Subject and methods: In 2019, all 54 primary schools were invited to participate in the new offer. To evaluate the project, a semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection in an interview with the person responsible for the breakfast in each of the participating schools. For the nutritional assessment of the food offer, the schools' self-selected food choices were compared with the breakfast recommendations of the Optimized Mixed Diet (OMD) for children and adolescents in Germany. Results: Fourteen of the 54 schools (26\%) participated in the project. The motivation for participation was most often the observation that children brought breakfast of poor quality. Breakfast was offered on almost all school days, and children could decide whether they wanted to take advantage of the food offer. Of the four components of breakfast required in the OMD, 100\% of schools regularly offered vegetables and fruits, 79\% offered cereal products and milk products, and 36\% a beverage. Acceptance by the pupils was evaluated positively by the schools. Conclusion: The municipal school breakfast project seems suitable for providing children with low-threshold access to a healthy breakfast, as the project schools generally selected foods in line with the OMD and were therefore able to tackle the problem of inadequate breakfast provision at home. © The Author(s) 2024.},

“The aim of this survey was to assess the feasibility and acceptance of a free breakfast offer (model project “School Breakfast”) at interested primary schools in the city of Bonn, Germany, with a focus on the food offer and framework conditions.” (Hockamp et al., 2024, p. 1)“ourteen of the 54 schools (26\%) participated in the project. The motivation for participation was most often the observation that children brought breakfast of poor quality. Breakfast was offered on almost all school days, and children could decide whether they wanted to take advantage of the food offer. Of the four components of breakfast required in the OMD, 100\% of schools regularly offered vegetables and fruits, 79\% offered cereal products and milk products, and 36\% a beverage. Acceptance by the pupils was evaluated positively by the schools.” (Hockamp et al., 2024, p. 1)“The municipal school breakfast project combines different prerequisites to make it promising for health promotion and prevention in children: (1) it is situated in obligatory primary schools and free of charge for the children, thus enabling low-threshold, effective access to socially disadvantaged children without stigmatization, (2) it focuses on breakfast as a significant component of a healthy and cognition-promoting diet for children, and (3) it leaves room for the schools to organize and establish the program without formal authoritative prescriptions.” (Hockamp et al., 2024, p. 4)“Although the municipal breakfast offer was open to all primary schools, the primary intention was that schools in disadvantaged areas in particular should be motivated to participate. In fact, the evaluation showed that the participating schools are highly representative of the social landscape of primary schools in the city of Bonn, suggesting that schools, regardless of their social status, had addressed the issue of breakfast and seized the chance to participate.” (Hockamp et al., 2024, p. 5)“Children are the ultimate target group of the project, especially children from socially disadvantaged backgrounds. All schools agreed that the breakfast offer was very well accepted by the children. Only a few schools reported a decline in interest over time. As breakfast was offered regularly several days a week in most schools and as the breakfast was largely composed in line with the OMD recommendations, it can be assumed that the breakfast as practiced could make the expected contribution to a healthy diet for the target groups. The fact that the schools were completely satisfied with the project and had no suggestions for improvement speaks for the feasibility of the offer under everyday school conditions. In view of the only moderate interest shown by parents in the school breakfast, the schools are all the more important as key stakeholders. The challenge remains to improve the networking of schools and parents in their responsibility for children's nutrition” (Hockamp et al., 2024, p. 5)“Whether the breakfast project actually achieves this goal cannot be answered with this short-term evaluation—but the municipal breakfast offers have the potential to improve children’s nutrition via schools, and ultimately promote children’s health, by combining the healthy food offer with the children's practical participation in breakfast preparation and theoretical nutrition education in the classroom” (Hockamp et al., 2024, p. 6)

The obesity rates in schools that employed dietitians were lower than in schools that did not (p {\textless} 0.001 in 2007, 2008). School lunches and childhood obesity exert a greater effect on boys than on girls. © 2015 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As such, the timing and availability of meals could alter a child's natural eating habits. This could impact the nutritional quality of what they eat as well. We conducted a field experiment with three fourth grade classes at a public elementary school in Eastern Connecticut to analyze if providing a nutritious snack one hour prior to lunch effects a child's level of hunger and consequently their lunch-time consumption. We found students shift their caloric and nutrient intake from lunch to snack time. In addition, we found a significant reduction in student hunger. Our results highlight the importance in considering the timing and quality of meals provided during school time.

“We found students shift their caloric and nutrient intake from lunch to snack time. In addition, we found a significant reduction in student hunger. Our results highlight the importance in considering the timing and quality of meals provided during school time. In our sample, current snack and lunch schedule may not be optimal and changing it can have an impact on the wellbeing of students. Providing healthful options for snack could be an effective way to improve student diets while preserving their ability to make their own choices” (Castellari and Berning, 2016, p. 70)“We next find that students increase their consumption of fat, proteins and sugar during snack, but reduce their consumption of carbohydrates and sugar during lunch. In general, these results indicate a shift in consumption from lunch to snack time. While this seems to suggest a zero-sum substitution in nutrient consumption from one time period to another, the sugar consumed at snack comes from milkda natural source of lactose. As such, students might be trading off processed sugars for natural sugars. This can be a potential benefit of providing a more healthful snack. For instance,” (Castellari and Berning, 2016, p. 76)“Overall, the results of our analysis suggest the nutritional quality of food available at school might not be optimal for children to regulate their level of hunger. If children have a natural ability to self-regulate food intake in response to caloric density cues (Birch et al., 1987), the school food environment may be constraining to students' “natural” consumption patterns. In particular, we find that the snack provision had an influence on student's consumption during snack and lunch and led them towards greater intake of proteins and fat and lesser in sugar and carbohydrates. The results from this study motivate important food policy considerations. First, is whether there is an opportunity to reshape the current school food distribution system. In particular, it may be valuable to consider the overall well-being of the student during school time, rather than just imposing restriction on the “nutrients” component of the diet. That is, it may be just as important to consider when students eat as it is to consider what they eat. A more ideal snack and lunch schedule might help students to selfregulate their food intake therefore, their hunger level. The promotion of an environment where children can self-regulate their needs might have potentially higher benefits than imposing strict rules which can lead to avoidance behavior” (Castellari and Berning, 2016, p. 77)“Our results suggest that schools could pursue several low-cost options to help improve students' dietary habits during lunch. First, schools could make healthful snacks, such as provided in our study, more readily available during snack time. In our study schools, students had to rely on their own snacks which were often less healthful. Schools might also consider the snack-lunch schedule. By allowing kids more frequent consumption periods, such as providing milk one to two hours prior to lunch, they may be able to regulate their hunger better. This might have a double benefit: first it might induce more healthful consumption and second it might have an influence on the students’ school performance.” (Castellari and Berning, 2016, p. 77)

In achieving this aim, the study sought to identify framing by policymakers regarding child diet and obesity; views on the role of schools in nutrition promotion; policy options and degree of support for these options. Issue framing by policymakers and policy option support are important considerations in policy design. Setting: New Zealand policymakers within the health and education policy community. Method: A qualitative study involving 16 semi-structured interviews with New Zealand policymakers. Results: Informants identified multiple drivers and complex causation of childhood obesity. Informants supported the role of schools in promoting nutrition, but recognized that issues external to schools such as poverty and availability of food placed limits on the effectiveness of actions within schools. Most informants agreed state policy was required across settings to encourage and support school nutrition promotion; however, there were some differences expressed in the degree to which state policy should regulate food options and marketing. Conclusion: New Zealand policymakers identify schools as a legitimate focus for policy development and commonly identify environmental contributions to child diet and obesity causation. This suggests a starting point for further policy deliberation and offers the possibility of further cross-sector policy development. The study provides an example for research elsewhere, and for international comparison. © The Author(s) 2012.},

“Within schools, education interventions have generally received more support, from a wider range of stakeholders, than interventions to reduce student exposure to less healthy foods through food bans, or making less healthy foods more expensive than healthier alternatives.” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 284)“Several informants, however, qualified this by stating that the role of schools is limited in some way. In particular, informants expressed the opinion that the primary responsibility of schools is to educate children. Opinion varied on the types of activities consistent with educating children, from environmental changes such as restricting the types of food available in school, to focussing only on nutrition education in the classroom. Most informants identified multiple roles for schools in promoting healthy nutrition. As one informant commented: [School is] the place that helps form their [children’s] attitudes and values, it’s the place that models behaviour, and it’s the place that can be a gate keeper around access . . . to the foods that we’re concerned with. (Informant 10)” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 286)“Regulating food in schools When informants discussed the regulation of food in school, tensions between school and parental responsibility for children’s diet were evident. A majority of informants supported regulating food available within schools, while no informant supported regulation of food brought into school from home. This seems to represent some middle ground between school and parental responsibility. It reinforces the role of schools being role models and sending messages to parents, without removing the central role of parental responsibility found within a more individual focussed issue framing. All informants (11 out of 16) that referred to the NAG 5 regulation or restrictions in the food available within schools indicated support for such restrictions. A few informants saw the NAG 5 as being the most significant action to improve children’s diets to date. One informant described the NAG as ‘powerful because of the fact that it will change the environment of the school’ (informant 10). Another informant described restricting the food available within the school as consistent with the school’s job to ‘. . . send messages and teach children . . . the most practical way that the school could do that was to say the food we provide is healthy food’ (informant 3). A small number of informants suggested that imposing regulations on schools was not the best approach, as responsibility for children’s diet rested more with parents, but also stated that the NAG 5 ‘ . . . seems to be accepted now . . .’ (informant 7), and acted as an impetus for change within schools.” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 287)“Home environment drivers and interventions Consistent with a more obesogenic environment framing of child obesity causation, most informants considered that efforts to promote nutrition in the school could be enhanced or inhibited by the home environment. Informants identified government as having primary responsibility for influencing nutrition within the home environment, with a potential supporting role for schools. Parents’ food choices were viewed as a strong driver of children’s diet, both inside the home and within schools. Two themes emerged regarding drivers of parents’ food choices: (1) skills and knowledge; and (2) economic and time resources. Several informants identified elements of parents’ knowledge around nutrition, cooking and the value parents place on healthy eating when discussing drivers within the home. Increasing parents’ knowledge was identified as an area for intervention by several informants, with potential for schools to reinforce wider nutrition education messages. Besides knowledge, time pressures on parents were commonly referred to, with a suggestion that people turn to processed foods when short of time, because of ‘. . . the convenience factor . . .’ (informant 4). Parents’ working hours were most commonly suggested as key to time pressure within the home.” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 287)“The commercial pressures from ‘the omniscient advertising that is all around us in society’ (informant 16) and easy availability of food for children were two aspects of the community environment identified by most informants as impacting on children’s diets. Marketing of food products was seen as related to children wanting certain food products, but also normalizing the types of food advertised. Food outlets surrounding schools were identified as a contributor to children’s diets by several informants, of whom most had worked directly with schools.” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 288)“nformants were asked if they supported greater restrictions on food marketing to children (e.g. television and print advertising restrictions),” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 288)“When asked, all informants thought further marketing restrictions were not currently politically viable. In contrast to schools’ potential influence on the home environment, informants seemed to view schools as having little ability or responsibility to influence the wider community setting to promote healthy nutrition. As with areas of poverty reduction, responsibility for actions such as food marketing restrictions and influencing availability of less healthy foods were seen as lying predominantly with the government.” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 288)“Across school, home and community settings, informants identified responsibility for action resting with a range of actors including the schools themselves, parents and government” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 288)“Consistent with an environmental frame, informants generally showed some support for policy options to make healthy food more affordable, restrict food marketing to children and require schools to meet certain standards in the food provided.” (Walton et al., 2013, p. 289)

Methods: Using 24-h dietary recall data from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 2.2 and 2015 CCHS – Nutrition, we constructed the Diet Quality Index (DQI). We used multivariable difference-in-differences regressions to quantify the DQI scores associated with school nutrition policy. We conducted stratified analyses by sex, school grade, household income, and food security status to gain additional insights into the impact of nutrition policy. Results: We found that mandatory school nutrition policy was associated with an increased DQI score by 3.44 points (95\% CI: 1.1, 5.8) during school-hours in intervention provinces relative to control provinces. DQI score was higher among males (3.8 points, 95\% CI: 0.6, 7.1) than among females (2.9 points, 95\% CI: −0.5, 6.3), and the score among students in elementary schools was higher (5.1 points, 95\% CI: 2.3, 8.0) than that among high school students (0.4 points, 95\% CI: −3.6, 4.5). We also found that DQI scores were higher for middle-high income and food secure households. Conclusion: Provincial mandatory school nutrition policy was associated with better diet quality among children and youth in Canada. Our findings suggest that other jurisdictions may consider implementing mandatory school nutrition policy. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive license to The Canadian Public Health Association.},

Mandatory school nutrition policy had no impact on diet quality during non-school-hours. We also found that school-hours diet quality scores were higher among male students, elementary school children, and food secure and middle-high income household groups. Our findings demonstrate that mandatory school nutrition policies may be useful in improving diet quality of children during school-hours, especially among elementary school children. Our results suggest that jurisdictions with school nutrition guidelines may consider implementing mandatory school nutrition policies to improve the diet quality of children and youth at school. A combination of healthy lifestyle interventions is likely necessary to produce long-lasting effects to improve the health of children. In order to improve overall diet quality, barriers to healthy eating outside the school environment, including food insecurity and marketing unhealthy foods to children, need to be addressed.” (Gaudin et al., 2023, p. 626)

	abstract = {Background: Salad bars have been promoted as a strategy for increasing fruit and vegetable consumption in schools. Objective: To examine school-level resources and programs associated with the presence of salad bars in elementary schools and to assess whether there were differential changes in salad bar prevalence based on school-level resources and programs before and after the new US Department of Agriculture schools meals standards were proposed (January 2011) and implemented (July 2012). Design: Repeated cross-sectional design. Data were collected annually between 2006-2007 and 2013. Setting: Nationally representative sample of 3,956 elementary schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. School personnel (ie, administrators and foodservice staff) provided data using a mail-back survey. Measures: Presence of salad bars in school was the primary outcome variable. School-level programs and resources were investigated as independent variables. Statistical analysis: Weighted logistic regression analyses examined associations between dependent and independent variables controlling for school demographic characteristics. Results: Prevalence of salad bars increased significantly from 17.1\% in 2006-2007 to 29.6\% in 2012-2013. The prevalence of salad bars was significantly higher among schools that participated in the Team Nutrition program (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.70), the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.13 to 1.95), a Farm to School program (OR 1.77, 95\% CI 1.36 to 2.33), and where school meals were provided by a foodservice management company (OR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.97). No association was found for schools with full-service kitchen, school gardens, those offering nutrition education, or those with dietitians/nutritionists on staff. Conclusions: Prevalence of salad bars increased significantly after the US Department of Agriculture school meal guidelines were proposed and implemented. It is likely that schools are using salad bars to offer a variety of fruits and vegetables to students, and schools with greater numbers of school-level resources and programs are better positioned for having salad bars. © 2016 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.},

The U.S. Department of Agriculture Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) is a national free-fruit and vegetable school distribution program designed to address this problem. This permanent, legislated program provides funding to qualified elementary schools for provision of additional fruit and vegetables outside of school meals. The objective of this study was to understand children’s perceptions of FFVP after the intervention and formulate recommendations that may improve success of the intervention. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Secondary data were obtained from 5,265 4th-6th graders at 51 randomly-selected FFVP intervention schools in Indiana. Anonymous questionnaires were completed late in the 2011-2012 academic year. Multilevel logistic regressions were used to determine associations between students’ perceptions of program effects (4 close-ended items) and their preference toward the program. Content analysis was applied to a single open-ended item for program comments. RESULTS: Over 47\% of students reported greater intake of fruit and vegetables due to FFVP, and over 66\% reported liking the program. Student-reported program effects were positively associated with preference for the program (P {\textless} 0.01). Themes that emerged during analysis of 3,811 comments, included, students liked: the opportunity to try different kinds of fruit and vegetables, types and flavors of fruits served, and benefits of eating fruit. Fewer students liked the types of vegetables and their benefits. A small group disliked the program citing poor flavor of vegetables and quality of fruits. Important suggestions for the program include serving more dipping sauces for vegetables, cooking vegetables, and providing a greater variety of produce. CONCLUSIONS: The degree that students liked FFVP may predict the program’s effects on fruit and vegetable intake. FFVP may become more acceptable to students by incorporating their suggestions. Program planners should consider these options for achieving program goals. © 2016 The Korean Nutrition Society and the Korean Society of Community Nutrition.},

“Objective: To assess lunchtime provision of food and drink in English primary schools and to assess both choices and consumption of food and drink by pupils having school lunches. These findings were compared with similar data collected in 2005. Design: Cross-sectional data collected between February and April 2009. In each school, food and drink provision, including portion weights and number of portions of each item served at lunchtime, were recorded over five consecutive days. Caterers provided school lunchtime menus and recipes. Setting: England. Subjects: A random selection of 6696 pupils having school lunches in a nationally representative sample of 136 primary schools in England. Results: Compared with 2005, schools in 2009 provided significantly more fruit, fruitbased desserts, vegetables and salad, water and fruit juice, and less ketchup, sauces and gravy, starchy foods cooked in fat, snacks and confectionery (P , 0?01). Pupils were also making healthier choices, choosing an average of 2?2 portions of fruit and vegetables from their ‘five a day’, but about one-third to two-fifths of these were wasted. Conclusions: Lunchtime food provision and consumption in primary schools have improved substantially since 2005, following the introduction of new standards for school food in 2008. However, improvements still need to be made to increase the Fe and Zn content and to decrease the Na content of recipes, and in encouraging pupils to eat more of the fruits and vegetables taken at lunchtime.” (Haroun et al., 2011, p. 209)“Compliance of provision with food-based standards and nutrient-based standards for school food Food-based standards Based on planned provision (i.e. over a full menu cycle), all schools met the standards for providing drinking water at all times, providing at least one portion of vegetable per day per child, and not providing snacks high in fat and salt (such as crisps). Over 80 \% of schools met the standards for providing healthier drinks such as fruit juice, extra bread without additional fat, at least one portion of fruit per day per child, at least one portion of oily fish in a three-week period, and restricting salt, condiments and confectionery. In relation to planned provision, the standards least often met were for meat products (74 \%) and starchy foods cooked in oil (72 \%); about one-quarter of schools were still serving sausages, burgers and chips more often than they should. In 2005, starchy foods cooked in fat (including chips, roast potatoes, etc.) were served on average 4?4d/week; in 2009, this had fallen to 3?4 d/week. The standard is not more than three times per week. Only for two items, vegetables and fruit, was actual provision less likely to meet the standards than planned provision. Compliance with the fruit standard was assessed against all fruit provided at lunchtime, including fruit as served, fruit juice and fruit in fruit-based desserts (containing an average of 40 \% fruit). Compliance with the vegetable standard was assessed against all vegetables provided at lunchtime, including vegetables as served (raw or cooked), portions of salad and in composite dishes including vegetables (containing an average of 28 \% vegetables). For vegetables, this shortfall was minimal: 58 \% of schools met the standard fully, a further 20 \% provided on average at least 90 portions of vegetables per 100 pupils, and only 7 \% of schools provided less than 80 portions per 100 pupils. For fruit, the shortfall was greater: 12 \% of schools provided a portion of fruit per pupil every day; a further 22 \% provided at least threequarters of a portion; a further 34 \% at least half a portion; and about one-third of schools were providing less than half a portion of fruit per pupil per day” (Haroun et al., 2011, p. 214)“Nutrient-based standards The mean energy and nutrient content of an average school lunch were compared with the NBS for primary schools (Table 4). Over 80 \% of schools met the standards for protein, carbohydrate, dietary fibre, vitamins A and C, folate and Ca. Around one-half of schools met the standards for fat, Fe and Zn. The standards met least often were for energy, NMES and Na. The energy content of the average school meal was above the standard. The average meal provided met ten of the fourteen NBS. Over 50 \% of schools met nine of the fourteen standards. One hundred and seventeen (86 \%) schools provided an average lunch that met between seven and ten standards, seventeen schools (13 \%) met more than ten, and only two schools (1 \%) provided meals that met fewer than seven standards.” (Haroun et al., 2011, p. 214)

A multi-component intervention consisting of cafeteria decorations, creative names, social norming taste tests, and flavor station components was implemented in three rural elementary school cafeterias by school nutrition services (SNS) and extension staff. Selection and consumption of fruits and vegetables at lunch were measured through monthly plate waste assessments over eight months (n = 1255 trays). Interviews were conducted with SNS staff (n = 3) upon completion of the intervention to assess implementation outcomes using validated acceptability and feasibility metrics. Consumption findings were generally inconsistent across schools and time points, yet fruit consumption increased at School 1 (p {\textless} 0.05) during the taste test and flavor station intervention months and School 2 (p {\textless} 0.001) during the creative names intervention months compared to baseline. Odds of selecting a vegetable at School 3 were three times higher than baseline during the taste test intervention months (odds ratio (OR), 3.0; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.3–6.5). Cafeteria decorations and taste tests had higher reported implementation metrics for acceptability and feasibility than other interventions. Thematic analysis underscored the facilitating role of extension support, as well as systems factors, which served as facilitators and barriers across schools and interventions. These findings suggest that nudge interventions are a promising strategy to improve vegetable selection and fruit consumption in school meal programs. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Objective To analyze the situation and influencing factors of school meals leftover among primary and secondary school students in the area of the Nutrition Improvement Program for Rural Compulsory Education Students, improve the quality of school meals, develop healthy dietary behavior, and reduce food waste. Methods In 2019, among the 50 monitoring counties that implemented the Compulsory Education Student Nutrition Improvement Program, two primary schools and two junior schools were randomly selected according to different food supply patterns.This study randomly selected one or two classes from grade 3 to grade 9. Basic information and school meals of 26 778 students were collected by using a student questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of leftovers rate. Results 54.93\% (14 709) of students wasted school meals, in which the highest rate was the staple food, with the main reason as "not in favor". 11.87\% (1 743) of the students wasted school meals 6-7 days a week, with 54.20\% (7 957) of students wasted but in less amount. The leftover rate of staple food was the highest (29.78\%), followed by vegetables and meat. The main reason of leftovers was that they didn't like this kind of food (33.52\%). The rate of school meal waste was higher for girls (OR=1.19, 95\%CI:1.13-1.25), junior high school students (OR=1.17, 95\%CI: 1.11-1.25), resident students (OR= 1.06, 95\%CI: 1.00-1.12), lower economic level (OR=1.06, 95\%CI: 1.00-1.12), parents working outside their houses (OR=1.22, 95\%CI: 1.13-1.30), health education classes (OR=1.70, 95\%CI: 1.40-2.06), company-based meals (OR=1.89, 95\%CI: 1.71-2.07) and school meals were not as good as home food (OR=1.89, 95\%CI: 1.78-2.00) (P{\textless}0.05). Conclusions It is common for poor rural primary and middle school students in central and western China to waste school meals, and the reasons were affected by many factors.

	abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to provide an application of Image Analysis techniques for school health policy evaluation. Image Analysis was used to extract information from school meal photographs. Extracted information is used to determine the baseline, characteristic of school food serving practices in accordance with the recently mandated Nutrition Standards for the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Programs (SBP), as authorized by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. Image acquisition of school lunch meals was conducted in 83 elementary schools nested in 44 school districts across six states in the United States. While school breakfast meals were acquired in 44 elementary schools nested in 13 school districts across four states in the United States. Consequently, over 600,000 food and beverage items were analyzed using Image Analysis protocols with Adaptive Neural Network systems of technologies. For NSLP, servings of fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, and milk were presented at the student, school, district and state levels of analyses for the school years 2010-2012. In addition, caloric intakes, sodium, saturated fat, macro and micro-nutrient patterns of consumption were analyzed for grade level compliance. For SBP, servings of fruits, milk, grains and caloric intake were evaluated. Data and procedures presented in this chapter are beneficial to schools, states, health officials, and policy makers in promoting and monitoring healthy school nutrition. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This longitudinal study examined school food offerings over time from school year 2010-11 to 2017-18 in public schools (n = 148) in four New Jersey cities. Six food indices were used to assess the number of healthy and unhealthy items offered as part of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), in vending machines, and à la carte (i.e., competitive foods). Multilevel, multivariable linear regression with quadratic terms was used to model the trends over time. Interaction terms were added to examine whether the time trends varied by school-level factors, such as proportion of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals (FRPMs), race/ethnicity of enrolled students, and school level. Over the study period, healthy items offered in the NSLP increased (p {\textless} 0.001), while unhealthy items in the NSLP decreased (p {\textless} 0.001). Significantly different rates of declines in NSLP unhealthy offering were observed among schools at the two extremes of FRPM eligibility (p {\textless} 0.05). The trends for healthy and unhealthy foods offered in competitive foods showed significant non-linear trends, and differences were observed for school-level race/ethnicity, with worse outcomes for schools with majority Black student enrollment. © 2023 by the authors.},

Overall, study results show that school food offerings in NSLP and competitive foods changed significantly over time and the timing of these changes aligned with major federal policy initiatives, such as the implementation of guidelines for reimbursable school meals and competitive foods. These changes in food offering over time did not affect all schools in the same way; significant differences in these trends were noted for race/ethnicity of enrolled students and for the proportion of students eligible for FRPMs. Consistent with previous research, the current study found improvements in the school food offerings over time as shown by a steady increase in the number of healthy items offered in the NSLP and a concurrent decrease in unhealthy NSLP items, which is likely to have occurred in response to the implementation of the HHFKA [23,40]. These trends suggest that national nutrition policies can impact student health through measurable changes in the foods offered in school meals. While health outcomes were not measured as part of this specific study, several studies have connected the improved school food environment post-HHFKA to improved nutrient intake and lower BMI among participating students

	abstract = {Despite growing school lunch availability in Germany, its utilization is still low, and students resort to unhealthy alternatives. We investigated predictors of school lunch participation and reasons for nonparticipation in 1215 schoolchildren.

Associations between school lunch participation and family-related predictors were estimated using logistic regression controlling for age and gender if necessary. School was added as a random effect. School lunch participation was primarily associated with family factors. While having breakfast on schooldays was positively associated with school lunch participation (ORadj = 2.20, p = 0.002), lower secondary schools (ORadj = 0.52, p {\textless} 0.001) and low SES (ORadj = 0.25, p {\textless} 0.001) were negatively associated. The main reasons for nonparticipation were school- and lunch-related factors (taste, time constraints, pricing). Parents reported pricing as crucial a reason as an unpleasant taste for nonparticipation. Nonparticipants bought sandwiches and energy drinks significantly more often on school days, whereas participants were less often affected by overweight (OR = 0.66, p = 0.043).

In general, school lunch participation was primarily associated with family-related factors (migration background, parental overweight, SES, families with many children). Most stated reasons for nonparticipation were school- and lunch-related factors like taste, pricing, and time constraints. Of note, one-third of the non-participants’ parents stated that their child would be more likely to participate if school lunch was free of charge.” (Sobek et al., 2021, p. 12)

	abstract = {The paper focused on evaluation of stakeholder capacity to implement the millennium village primary school meal project in Kenya. The study which was anchored on the stakeholder theory as well as the Context Input Process Product (CIPP) model of evaluation used mixed methods research design with ex-post facto and case study as its two research elements. The mixed methods was adopted because when both qualitative and quantitative approaches are used in a single study, the strengths of both produce a research synergy in which the collective benefits are greater than what is obtained from either approach when used alone. A sample size of 186 participants was selected from seven (7) primary schools using stratified random sampling. The participants selected purposively included pupils, teachers, head teachers, parents, Area Education Officer (AEO) and project staff. Data was collected using questionnaires, face to face interview guide, Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and document analysis guide. The study findings indicated that the project was implemented with great success as indicated by stakeholders’ capacity to understand project objectives, their involvement in project planning and implementation and their positive attitude towards the project. This has contribute to poverty reduction in the community through the project and sustainable approaches for project implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},
