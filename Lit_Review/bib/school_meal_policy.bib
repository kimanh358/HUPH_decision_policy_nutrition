Statistics on School Meal Organization:


According to statistics from the 2019–2020 academic year, only 26,392 kitchens existed in 55,335 preschool institutions (47.7\%), including 15,461 schools, 23,960 satellite campuses, and 15,914 independent class groups. In primary schools, only about 5,000 out of 15,000 schools organized school meals, with more than 3,300 schools having kitchens and over 700 schools using pre-prepared industrial meals.


The organization of school meals faces several difficulties and challenges. Infrastructure for meal preparation and service remains inadequate, particularly in remote, mountainous, and economically disadvantaged areas. Investment in menu planning and ensuring meals meet nutritional and energy needs for children is still insufficient.


Awareness of the role and necessity of school meals with proper nutrition remains incomplete among some school leaders, staff, teachers, parents, and students.


There is a shortage of both quantity and quality of personnel responsible for organizing school meals that meet nutritional and food safety standards.


School canteens lack specific regulations and technical guidelines for scientific implementation, affecting students' healthy eating behaviors.


Reports indicate that nearly 40\% of schools with collective kitchens and canteens do not meet food hygiene and safety standards. Supervision and management of school meals remain inadequate.


In 2020, there were 90 food poisoning incidents nationwide, affecting 2,254 people. Some of these incidents occurred in schools, impacting students' health and causing concern among parents. Strengthening food hygiene and safety measures in educational institutions is crucial.





Part II: Guidelines for Organizing School Meals (Pages 13–29)
Part IV: Roles of Authorities, Institutions, and Schools


Role of Schools:● The student health care committee assigns specific responsibilities to its members, including school administrators, teachers, school medical staff, and parent representatives. The school administration oversees school meal organization.● Conduct health assessments at the beginning of the school year to evaluate students' nutritional and health status, enabling the school to monitor student health and provide effective nutritional care.● Ensure adequate facilities and equipment for organizing nutritionally balanced school meals, providing diverse food options tailored to children's needs and school resources.● Integrate nutrition education into school meal activities, extracurricular sessions, and experiential activities to help students learn about different food groups, healthy and unhealthy foods, self-serving, maintaining hygiene during meals, and cleaning up after eating.● Enhance communication about school nutrition with parents and strengthen school-family collaboration to achieve set nutritional goals.● Engage parents in supporting school meal organization, particularly in schools lacking kitchen staff. Encourage local organizations to contribute to food production for schools.● Establish mechanisms for parent involvement in monitoring and inspecting school meal processes to build trust in meal quality.● Ensure adequate staff and teachers are trained in food safety and nutrition to organize safe and healthy school meals.● Regularly or periodically inspect and supervise school meal organization as per the plan.


Role of Families:● Collaborate with schools in child care and nutrition. Parents should understand school meal plans to coordinate home meals that meet students' daily energy needs while fostering a supportive learning and physical activity environment.● Prepare meals different from those served at school to make home dining enjoyable, following the principle of diverse food selection. Work with schools to educate children about nutrition and develop healthy eating habits.● Avoid late-night meals after 8 PM and limit children's consumption of sugary and salty foods.

Recently, the implementation of food safety measures in educational institutions has generally been directed and carried out seriously and effectively. However, in recent times, some educational institutions have failed to strictly comply with food safety regulations. Violations include the use of unsanitary food for meal preparation, contracting pre-prepared meals from businesses without food safety certification, employing staff without food safety training, using externally mixed milk of uncertain safety, and advertising or selling processed foods, fast food, pastries, sausages, soft drinks, and carbonated beverages of unclear origin in school canteens. Notably, cases of food poisoning among students in some institutions have affected their health and well-being, damaged the school's reputation, caused concern among students' families, and sparked public outcry.
Responsibilities of Educational Institutions and Authorities:


Enhancing Awareness and Education:Educational institutions should strengthen information dissemination, communication, and education to raise awareness, responsibility, and knowledge about food safety and food poisoning prevention among school administrators, teachers, staff, students, and parents. Close coordination between schools and families is essential to educate and guide students on food safety and proper nutrition, taking into account the age, physical condition, and family circumstances of each student.


Strict Compliance with Food Safety Regulations:Schools with boarding meal services and on-campus canteens must strictly adhere to food safety regulations. This includes ensuring that all kitchen staff, canteen workers, and food storage and processing facilities meet hygiene and safety standards. Schools must not use unsanitary food for meal preparation or contract meal services that fail to meet food safety regulations and lack the necessary certification.


Prohibiting Harmful Products in Schools:Schools must not advertise or sell alcoholic beverages, carbonated soft drinks, and other unhealthy food products on campus. There should be close cooperation with local authorities to prevent the sale and marketing of alcohol, beer, and other alcoholic beverages in school canteens, cafeterias, dormitories, and within the school premises.


Implementing the School Milk Program:Educational institutions participating in the School Milk Program must ensure proper organization and guidance for students to consume milk safely. Strict compliance with the Ministry of Health's food safety regulations is required to guarantee absolute safety for children and students while drinking milk.
