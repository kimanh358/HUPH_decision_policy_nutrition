Overview of School Meal Provision in Vietnam
This section provides a comprehensive overview of the history, current policies, challenges, and key stakeholders involved in Vietnam’s school meal programs. By analyzing these aspects, this review highlights successes and gaps in policy implementation and identifies areas for potential improvement to align with international best practices (WFP | The State of School Feeding Worldwide 2022, n.d.).
Historical Development of School Meals in Vietnam
Vietnam’s school meal programs have evolved significantly, shaped by economic policies, international support, and government initiatives. Prior to the 1986 Renovation economic reforms, Vietnam’s education and nutrition policies were centrally planned, with limited resources allocated for school meal provision. During this period, most schools, particularly in rural and disadvantaged areas, lacked proper kitchen facilities and structured meal plans, leading to widespread malnutrition among students (Trung Le, 2012).
Following the economic liberalization of the late 1980s, Vietnam saw an expansion of privatized food services and foreign aid support. International organizations such as UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) began supporting school feeding initiatives, particularly in ethnic minority and remote communities. By the 2000s, the Vietnamese government introduced national nutrition guidelines to ensure school meals met basic dietary requirements (WFP | The State of School Feeding Worldwide 2022, n.d.).
In 2016, the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) collaborated on Circular 13/2016/TTLT-BYT-BGDĐT, which established school nutrition and hygiene standards​. This policy aimed to address malnutrition, food safety concerns, and meal standardization. However, despite these policy efforts, inequities in school meal access and quality remain a significant challenge (Randby et al., 2024).
Current School Meal Policies and Regulations
The Vietnamese school meal system has gradually evolved from scattered and informal food services to more formalized programs guided by national laws and policies. One of the most important legislative frameworks is the Law on Education, which emphasizes the responsibility of schools to support students’ physical and mental development, including health and nutrition initiatives (19). Complementing this is the Law on Food Safety, which governs hygiene standards in all food-related operations, including those in schools (20)​​.
In recent years, the government has issued several key policies specifically targeting school nutrition. For example, Decision no 2195/QĐ-BGDĐT (2022) provides detailed guidance on organizing school meals in preschools, emphasizing balanced nutrition, safety, and coordination with physical activity programs (24)​. Similarly, Decision 41/QĐ-TTg (2018) aims to ensure rational nutrition and promote physical activity among children and students, with long-term goals of preventing non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions​. These documents form the backbone of current policy efforts to integrate school meals into national health promotion strategies (25).
The National Nutrition Strategy further reinforces the government’s commitment to improving child nutrition through structured school feeding programs. This strategy outlines the need to ensure all students, especially in disadvantaged areas, have access to at least one nutritious meal per school day (26). It prioritizes food diversity, micronutrient adequacy, and locally sourced ingredients, aiming to align school meals with sustainable agricultural and economic development goals​.
In terms of implementation, school meals in Vietnam are organized at various levels of government. The Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) plays a leading role in policy development and oversight, while provincial Departments of Education coordinate implementation within their jurisdictions. Many schools, especially in urban areas, partner with external catering services that are responsible for meal preparation, delivery, and hygiene compliance. However, the level of service provision varies greatly across regions. In rural and remote areas, limited infrastructure, low parental income, and resource constraints often limit access to quality meals.
To address nutritional disparities, Vietnam launched the School Milk Program, which provided subsidized milk to preschool and early primary students in targeted regions (27). Accompanied by Circular 31/2019/TT-BYT, which sets quality standards for milk used in schools, this program aimed to improve stature and micronutrient intake among young children​​. Although the program has shown some success, particularly in improving access to dairy among poor households, challenges remain in maintaining consistent quality and coverage across provinces (28).
Another notable development is the School Health Program (Decision no 1660/QĐ-TTg, 2021–2025), which includes objectives to improve school nutrition, hygiene education, and physical activity (29). This program emphasizes the role of trained school health staff and includes targets for student nutrition screening and meal supervision​. In line with this, Decision no 4202/QĐ-BGDĐT (2022) was issued to enhance the capacity of school medical personnel, aiming to strengthen their role in monitoring food safety and managing health education in schools​ (30). An important development in Vietnam’s school health and nutrition policy landscape is the issuance of Decision no 85/QĐ-TTg, dated January 19, 2022, which approves the National Program for Monitoring the Implementation of School Health Activities for the 2021–2025 period (31). While the scope of this policy extends beyond nutrition to include areas such as health education, physical activity, mental health, and hygiene, it holds significant relevance for school meal provision. The decision emphasizes the need for systematic data collection, the development of digital databases, and the use of standardized indicators to monitor student health and school nutrition outcomes. By institutionalizing monitoring and evaluation, Decision 85 supports the implementation of broader policies such as the School Health Program (Decision no 1660/QĐ-TTg, 2021–2025) and the National Nutrition Strategy (Decision no 02/QĐ-TTg, 2021–2030). It also reinforces the governance structure necessary for accountability and continuous improvement in school feeding programs (26,29,31).
Despite significant policy advancements, implementation of school meal programs in Vietnam remains uneven. In urban centers like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, schools are more likely to provide daily lunches that meet safety and nutrition standards. These meals are often prepared by contracted food service providers and are subject to regular inspections. In contrast, schools in rural and mountainous regions often lack kitchen facilities, cold storage, and safe water sources. Many depend on food brought from home or on contributions from parents, leading to concerns about hygiene and nutritional adequacy.
Moreover, food safety remains a key concern. The government has attempted to address this through policies such as Directive 4316/CT-BGDĐT (2018), which mandates stricter food safety measures in educational institutions, including regular inspections, hygiene training for food handlers, and reporting mechanisms for foodborne illness outbreaks (32)​. Decree 15/2018/NĐ-CP also serves as a comprehensive guide to the implementation of food safety regulations in schools, aligning with broader food safety laws nationwide​. Yet enforcement at the local level can be inconsistent due to limited capacity and overlapping responsibilities among agencies (17).
